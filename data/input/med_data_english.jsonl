{"id": "WOS_0", "text": "An improved method for soft tissue modeling The technique of force and haptic reappearance is an effective method to solve the shortage of haptic presence and improve the medical robots' practicability. Soft tissue models, the core of force-haptic reappearance systems, play a decisive role in its performance. The establishment of realistic soft tissue models can improve the system's authenticity and efficiency and better realize the representation of force and touch in the interaction process.At present, there exists a contradiction between timeliness and accuracy in soft tissue modeling. This paper combined the finite element method with the mass-spring model. We estimated the mass-spring model's parameters with the finite element method by neglecting the damping coefficient and obtained the relationship between the elastic coefficients. Then, according to the real measurement data of soft tissue in literature and the stress-strain curve obtained from real measurement, the values of a, A, epsilon, k(s) sigma were determined. Through those methods above, an improved soft tissue model was obtained. Through our comparison experiments, the improved spring particle model has a high degree of data fitting, and the force value under the same displacement is smaller. Moreover, the improved model's force-displacement curve in the large deformation stage is still very close to the measurement curve of the volume, which cannot be achieved by the empirical spring particle model. These comparative experiments show that the improved finite element-based particle spring model can better consider the timeliness and accuracy and simulate the soft tissue more accurately."}

Insights from academic research and business developments Healthcare research is a multidisciplinary field that looks at the entire stakeholder ecosystem. Digital transformation could assist in the resolution of problems in medical practice by introducing new value creation trends. Blockchain technology has the potential to help speed up this digital transformation process by reducing certain elements, such as data management issues. As with any new technology, its actual value must be shown because it is based on expectations rather than solid facts. This study compares the findings of a content analysis focused on papers and patents with the aim of presenting data on the expectations for blockchain implementation in the healthcare sector. While the papers provide the perspective of researchers, patents should depict the expectation of the companies and investors patenting their inventions. Comparing data from papers and patents, this paper aims to help close the research-practice gap by showing how the two expectations for blockchain application in the healthcare sector are evolving."}

The magnetic field control part generates a magnetic field by controlling the magnetization directions of dual permanent magnets (PMs) using motors, and the robot arm part supports and freely moves the magnetic field control part in three dimensions. First, we calculated the magnetic field generated by the dual PMs of the MNS by utilizing point-dipole approximation, and the magnetic force between the PMs of the MNS and the CE. We set up an optimal design problem to determine the rotational angles of the magnetization direction of the dual PMs of the MNS to align the CE to the given direction. We validated the proposed optimal design problem by utilizing finite element analysis. By using the developed MNS and a commercial CE, we measured the magnetic force acting on the CE and compared it with the simulated results of the finite element analysis. Finally, we performed a gastric endoscopy in a mimetic stomach and confirmed that the proposed MNS can effectively examine the major parts of a stomach."}

However, for most surgical procedures, the details of intraoperative surgical actions, which can vary widely, are not well understood. Here we report a machine learning system leveraging a vision transformer and supervised contrastive learning for the decoding of elements of intraoperative surgical activity from videos commonly collected during robotic surgeries. The system accurately identified surgical steps, actions performed by the surgeon, the quality of these actions and the relative contribution of individual video frames to the decoding of the actions. Through extensive testing on data from three different hospitals located in two different continents, we show that the system generalizes across videos, surgeons, hospitals and surgical procedures, and that it can provide information on surgical gestures and skills from unannotated videos. Decoding intraoperative activity via accurate machine learning systems could be used to provide surgeons with feedback on their operating skills, and may allow for the identification of optimal surgical behaviour and for the study of relationships between intraoperative factors and postoperative outcomes.A machine learning system leveraging a vision transformer and supervised contrastive learning accurately decodes elements of intraoperative surgical activity from videos commonly collected during robotic surgeries."}

Dedicated terminology, techniques, devices, courses, and training programs have enabled progressive advancements. However, only a few randomized trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CTO percutaneous coronary intervention. Moreover, several published observational studies have shown conflicting data. Part of the paucity of clinical data stems from the fact that prior studies have been suboptimally designed and performed. The absence of standardized end points and the discrepancy in definitions also prevent consistency and uniform interpretability of reported results in CTO intervention. To standardize the field, we therefore assembled a broad consortium comprising academicians, practicing physicians, researchers, medical society representatives, and regulators (US Food and Drug Administration) to develop methods, end points, biomarkers, parameters, data, materials, processes, procedures, evaluations, tools, and techniques for CTO interventions. This article summarizes the effort and is organized into 3 sections: key elements and procedural definitions, end point definitions, and clinical trial design principles. The Chronic Total Occlusion Academic Research Consortium is a first step toward improved comparability and interpretability of study results, supplying an increasingly growing body of CTO percutaneous coronary intervention evidence."}

This has increased the need for graphic tools that allow the concurrent visualization of genomes and feature-associated multi-omics data on single publication-ready plots. Results We present chromoMap, an R package, developed for the construction of interactive visualizations of chromosomes/chromosomal regions, mapping of any chromosomal feature with known coordinates (i.e., protein coding genes, transposable elements, non-coding RNAs, microsatellites, etc.), and chromosomal regional characteristics (i.e. genomic feature density, gene expression, DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, etc.) of organisms with a genome assembly. ChromoMap can also integrate multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics) in relation to their occurrence across chromosomes. ChromoMap takes tab-delimited files (BED like) or alternatively R objects to specify the genomic co-ordinates of the chromosomes and elements to annotate. Rendered chromosomes are composed of continuous windows of a given range, which, on hover, display detailed information about the elements annotated within that range. By adjusting parameters of a single function, users can generate a variety of plots that can either be saved as static image or as HTML documents. Conclusions ChromoMap's flexibility allows for concurrent visualization of genomic data in each strand of a given chromosome, or of more than one homologous chromosome; allowing the comparison of multi-omic data between genotypes (e.g. species, varieties, etc.) or between homologous chromosomes of phased diploid/polyploid genomes. chromoMap is an extensive tool that can be potentially used in various bioinformatics analysis pipelines for genomic visualization of multi-omics data."}

The model describes the spatiotemporal spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and aims to capture dynamics also based on human habits and geographical features. To test the model, we compare the outputs generated by a finite-element solver with measured data over the Italian region of Lombardy, which has been heavily impacted by this crisis between February and April 2020. Our results show a strong qualitative agreement between the simulated forecast of the spatio-temporal COVID-19 spread in Lombardy and epidemiological data collected at the municipality level. Additional simulations exploring alternative scenarios for the relaxation of lockdown restrictions suggest that reopening strategies should account for local population densities and the specific dynamics of the contagion. Thus, we argue that data-driven simulations of our model could ultimately inform health authorities to design effective pandemic-arresting measures and anticipate the geographical allocation of crucial medical resources.

In these bacteria, antimicrobial resistance genes are often associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which promote their mobility, enabling them to rapidly spread throughout a bacterial community.Methods: The tool MobileElementFinder was developed to enable rapid detection of MGEs and their genetic context in assembled sequence data. MGEs are detected based on sequence similarity to a database of 4452 known elements augmented with annotation of resistance genes, virulence factors and detection of plasmids.Results: MobileElementFinder was applied to analyse the mobilome of 1725 sequenced Salmonella enterica isolates of animal origin from Denmark, Germany and the USA. We found that the MGEs were seemingly conserved according to multilocus ST and not restricted to either the host or the country of origin. Moreover, we identified putative translocatable units for specific aminoglycoside, sulphonamide and tetracycline genes. Several putative composite transposons were predicted that could mobilize, among others, AMR, metal resistance and phosphodiesterase genes associated with macrophage survivability. This is, to our knowledge, the first time the phosphodiesterase-Like pdeL has been found to be potentially mobilized into S. enterica.Conclusions: MobileElementFinder is a powerful tool to study the epidemiology of MGEs in a Large number of genome sequences and to determine the potential for genomic plasticity of bacteria.

The existing approaches tend to learn spatial filter parameters of a certain target using only the training data from the same stimulus, and they rarely consider the information from other stimuli or the volume conduction problem during the training process. In this article, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization-based high-pass spatial filtering method to improve the SSVEP detection accuracy and robustness. The filters are derived via maximizing the correlation between the training signal and the individual template from the same target whilst minimizing the correlation between the signal from other targets and the template. The optimization will also be subject to the constraint that the sum of filter elements is zero. The evaluation study on two self-collected SSVEP datasets (including 12 and four frequencies, respectively) shows that the proposed method outperformed the compared methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA), multiset CCA (MsetCCA), sum of squared correlations (SSCOR), and task-related component analysis (TRCA). The proposed method was also verified on a public 40-class SSVEP benchmark dataset recorded from 35 subjects. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach for enhancing the SSVEP detection performance."}

However, studies estimating human health risks in urban dusts from a global perspective are scarce. We evaluated data for twelve PTEs in urban dusts across 59 countries from 463 published articles, including their concentrations, input sources, and probabilistic risks to human health. We found that 34.1 and 60.3% of those investigated urban dusts have been heavily contaminated with As and Cd, respectively. The input of PTEs was significantly correlated with economic structure due to emissions of industrial activities and traffic emissions being the major sources. Based on the Monte Carlo simulation, we found that the mean hazard index below the safe threshold (1.0) could still cause non-negligible risks to human health. Arsenic and Cr were the major PTEs threatening human health, and relatively high risk levels were observed in cities in China, Korea, Chile, Malaysia, and Australia. Importantly, our analysis suggested that PTEs threaten the health of approximately 92 million adults and 280 million children worldwide. Overall, our study provides important foundational understanding and guidance for policy decision-making to reduce the potential risks associated with PTE exposure and to promote sustainable development of urban economies."}

We collected descriptive summary data of core elements of the latest Utstein style recommendation during 2016 and 2017 at each registry. For registries that participated in the previous 2015 report, we also extracted the 2015 data.Results: Eleven national registries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania, and 4 regional registries in Europe were included in this report. Across registries, the estimated annual incidence of EMS-treated OHCA was 30.0-97.1 individuals per 100,000 population in 2015, 36.4-97.3 in 2016, and 40.8-100.2 in 2017.

Further analysis on error shows that the constructed model shows the smallest error of 23.34 pixels. Therefore, it is proved that the built SHPE model shows higher prediction accuracy and smaller error while ensuring the safety performance, which provides an experimental reference for the prediction and evaluation of smart healthcare treatment in the later stage."}
{"id": "WOS_26", "text": "Multi-level feature fusion for multimodal human activity recognition in Internet of Healthcare Things Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has become a crucial element for smart healthcare applications due to the fast adoption of wearable sensors and mobile technologies. Most of the existing human activity recognition frameworks deal with a single modality of data that degrades the reliability and recognition accuracy of the system for heterogeneous data sources. In this article, we propose a multi-level feature fusion technique for multimodal human activity recognition using multi-head Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Convolution Block Attention Module (CBAM) to process the visual data and Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) for dealing with the time-sensitive multi-source sensor information. The architecture is developed to be able to analyze and retrieve channel and spatial dimension features through the use of three branches of CNN along with CBAM for visual information. The ConvLSTM network is designed to capture temporal features from the multiple sensors' time-series data for efficient activity recognition. An open-access multimodal HAR dataset named UP-Fall detection dataset is utilized in experiments and evaluations to measure the performance of the developed fusion architecture. Finally, we deployed an Internet of Things (IoT) system to test the proposed fusion network in real-world smart healthcare application scenarios. The findings from the experimental results reveal that the developed multimodal HAR framework surpasses the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of multiple performance metrics."}

The Burden of Antibiotic Resistance in Neonates from Developing Societies (BARNARDS) network was initiated to characterize the cause and burden of antimicrobial resistance in neonatal sepsis for seven LMICs in Africa and South Asia. A total of 36,285 neonates were enrolled in the BARNARDS study between November 2015 and December 2017, of whom 2,483 were diagnosed with culture-confirmed sepsis. Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 258) was the main cause of neonatal sepsis, with Serratia marcescens (n = 151), Klebsiella michiganensis (n = 117), Escherichia coli (n = 75) and Enterobacter cloacae complex (n = 57) also detected. We present whole-genome sequencing, antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical data for 916 out of 1,038 neonatal sepsis isolates (97 isolates were not recovered from initial isolation at local sites). Enterobacterales (K. pneumoniae, E. coli and E. cloacae) harboured multiple cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance genes. All isolated pathogens were resistant to multiple antibiotic classes, including those used to treat neonatal sepsis. Intraspecies diversity of K. pneumoniae and E. coli indicated that multiple antibiotic-resistant lineages cause neonatal sepsis. Our results will underpin research towards better treatments for neonatal sepsis in LMICs."}

Here we aggregate, process and release a dataset of 76,156 human genomes from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)-the largest public open-access human genome allele frequency reference dataset-and use it to build a genomic constraint map for the whole genome (genomic non-coding constraint of haploinsufficient variation (Gnocchi)). We present a refined mutational model that incorporates local sequence context and regional genomic features to detect depletions of variation. As expected, the average constraint for protein-coding sequences is stronger than that for non-coding regions. Within the non-coding genome, constrained regions are enriched for known regulatory elements and variants that are implicated in complex human diseases and traits, facilitating the triangulation of biological annotation, disease association and natural selection to non-coding DNA analysis. More constrained regulatory elements tend to regulate more constrained protein-coding genes, which in turn suggests that non-coding constraint can aid the identification of constrained genes that are as yet unrecognized by current gene constraint metrics. We demonstrate that this genome-wide constraint map improves the identification and interpretation of functional human genetic variation.A genomic constraint map for the human genome constructed using data from 76,156 human genomes from the Genome Aggregation Database shows that non-coding constrained regions are enriched for regulatory elements and variants associated with complex diseases and traits."}

However, most integrons are presumably sedentary and encode a much broader diversity of functions. IntegronFinder is a widely used software to identify novel integrons in bacterial genomes, but has aged and lacks some useful functionalities to handle very large datasets of draft genomes or metagenomes.

We also take full advantage of its novel capabilities to analyze close to 4000 Klebsiella pneumoniae genomes for the presence of integrons and antibiotic resistance genes within them. Our data show that K. pneumoniae has a large diversity of integrons and the largest mobile integron in our database of plasmids.

The amount of monitoring data for the normal condition is far more than the monitoring data for different fault conditions. Simultaneously, traditional intelligent diagnosis methods are primarily based on the assumption of the balanced distribution of data categories. To this end, this paper designs a new class imbalanced fault diagnosis framework of the bearing-rotor system based on Normalized Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder with Adaptive Focal Loss (NCVAE-AFL). The critical point of this diagnostic framework is to use the designed NCVAE algorithm to enhance the data's feature learning ability. The multi-layer sensitive feature vectors of the data can be extracted, the generalization performance of the diagnostic framework is further improved. Meanwhile, a new Adaptive Focus Loss (AFL) function is designed for NCVAE model, which focuses training on a few samples of health conditions that are difficult to classify and balance the diagnosis difficulty of the numerous sample categories. Finally, the double-span bearing-rotor system fault simulation experiment platform verifies the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NCVAE-AFL algorithm and its diagnostic framework. The diagnosis results demonstrate that the proposed diagnosis framework's accuracy and stability are better than other latest methods when dealing with the class imbalanced fault data of mechanical systems."}

As drugmakers invest in developing psychedelic medicines for several psychiatric indications, lawmakers are enacting legal reforms to speed access globally, and health agencies are preparing to approve these treatments. Meanwhile, US states, such as Oregon and Colorado, are making psychedelics available for supervised use outside the conventional health care system. Observations Despite legal change and potentially imminent regulatory approval in some countries, standards for integrating psychedelics into health care have lagged, including norms for designing and implementing informed consent processes. Informed consent is complicated by the unique features of psychedelics and their means of administration. Because no governments have approved any classic psychedelics for general medical or psychiatric use, only clinical researchers have obtained informed consent from trial participants. Accordingly, there is an unmet need for informed consent processes tailored to the challenges of administering psychedelics in nonresearch settings. Conclusions and Relevance Analysis of the challenges of designing and implementing psychedelic informed consent practices revealed 7 essential components, including the possibility of short- and long-term perceptual disturbances, potential personality changes and altered metaphysical beliefs, the limited role of reassuring physical touch, the potential for patient abuse or coercion, the role and risks of data collection, relevant practitioner disclosures, and interactive patient education and comprehension assessment. Because publicly available informed consent documents for psychedelic clinical trials often overlook or underemphasize these essential elements, sample language and procedures to fill the gap are proposed."}

Secondary endpoints were readmission rate, complications, and cost.Results. A total of 31 studies (6703 patients) were included: 5 randomized controlled trials, and 26 cohort studies. Meta-analysis of 27 studies (6345 patients) demonstrated a decrease in LOS of 1.6 days (95% confidence interval, CI 1.2-2.1) with ERAS implementation. Meta-analysis of 21 studies (4974 patients) demonstrated a 32% reduction in complications (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55-0.83) and a 20% reduction in readmission (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-0.99) for ERAS patients. There was no difference in 30-day postoperative mortality (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.23-1.6) for ERAS patients compared to controls. No difference in the odds of complications or reduction in LOS was observed based on number of included ERAS elements or reported compliance with ERAS interventions. The mean cost savings for ERAS patients was $2129 USD (95% CI $712 -$3544). Conclusions. ERAS protocols decrease LOS, complications, and cost without increasing rates of readmission or mortality in gynecologic oncology surgery.

{"id": "WOS_51", "text": "ADAR1 masks the cancer immunotherapeutic promise of ZBP1-driven necroptosis Only a small proportion of patients with cancer show lasting responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based monotherapies. The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 is an emerging determinant of resistance to ICB therapy and prevents ICB responsiveness by repressing immunogenic double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), such as those arising from the dysregulated expression of endogenous retroviral elements (EREs)(1-4). These dsRNAs trigger an interferon-dependent antitumour response by activating A-form dsRNA (A-RNA)-sensing proteins such as MDA-5 and PKR5. Here we show that ADAR1 also prevents the accrual of endogenous Z-form dsRNA elements (Z-RNAs), which were enriched in the 3 ' untranslated regions of interferon-stimulated mRNAs. Depletion or mutation of ADAR1 resulted in Z-RNA accumulation and activation of the Z-RNA sensor ZBP1, which culminated in RIPK3-mediated necroptosis. As no clinically viable ADAR1 inhibitors currently exist, we searched for a compound that can override the requirement for ADAR1 inhibition and directly activate ZBP1. We identified a small molecule, the curaxin CBL0137, which potently activates ZBP1 by triggering Z-DNA formation in cells. CBL0137 induced ZBP1-dependent necroptosis in cancer-associated fibroblasts and reversed ICB unresponsiveness in mouse models of melanoma. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ADAR1 represses endogenous Z-RNAs and identifies ZBP1-mediated necroptosis as a new determinant of tumour immunogenicity masked by ADAR1. Therapeutic activation of ZBP1-induced necroptosis provides a readily translatable avenue for rekindling the immune responsiveness of ICB-resistant human cancers."}

Currently, there is debate on recommendations for selenium supplementation as a public health measure to improve immune function and reduce infectious disease susceptibility.Objectives: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies assessing the effect of selenium supplementation on immunity-related outcomes in healthy people. Methods: We undertook a search of published and unpublished studies in literature databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov up to 17 October, 2022, and performed a meta-analysis comparing the effects on immunity-related outcomes between Se-supplemented versus control arms. Whenever possible we assessed the nonlinear relation using a dose-response approach.Results: 9 trials were included, 5 in North America, and 4 in Europe, with a duration between 8 and 48 weeks and supplementation of both inorganic and organic selenium forms. Selenium supplementation did not substantially affect immunoglobulin or white blood cell concentrations, and the dose-response meta-analysis indicated that an increase in plasma selenium concentrations above 100 mu g/L did not further increase IgA levels nor T cells. An inverted U-shaped relation emerged for NK cell count, with a lower number of these cells both below and above 120 mu g/L. The only beneficial effect of selenium supplementation was the increased activity for NK lysis, but the available data did not permit dose-response analysis. Cytokine levels were substantially unaffected by selenium supplementation.Conclusions: Although some of the data suggested beneficial effects of selenium supplementation on immune function, the overall picture appears to be inconsistent and heterogeneous due to differences in trial duration and interventions, plus evidence of null and even detrimental effects. Overall, the evidence that we extracted from the literature in this systematic review does not support the need to supplement selenium beyond the recommended dietary intake to obtain beneficial effects on immune function."}

Here, to identify factors that modulate the immune sensitivity of cancer cells, we performed in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screens targeting 936 chromatin regulators in mouse tumour models treated with immune checkpoint blockade. We identified the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 and other members of the HUSH and KAP1 complexes as mediators of immune escape(3-5). We also found that amplification of SETDB1 (1q21.3) in human tumours is associated with immune exclusion and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. SETDB1 represses broad domains, primarily within the open genome compartment. These domains are enriched for transposable elements (TEs) and immune clusters associated with segmental duplication events, a central mechanism of genome evolution(6). SETDB1 loss derepresses latent TE-derived regulatory elements, immunostimulatory genes, and TE-encoded retroviral antigens in these regions, and triggers TE-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in vivo. Our study establishes SETDB1 as an epigenetic checkpoint that suppresses tumour-intrinsic immunogenicity, and thus represents a candidate target for immunotherapy."}
{"id": "WOS_54", "text": "Ecological and evolutionary solutions to the plasmid paradox The 'plasmid paradox' arises because, although plasmids are common features of bacterial genomes, theoretically they should not exist: rates of conjugation were believed insufficient to allow plasmids to persist by infectious transmission, whereas the costs of plasmid maintenance meant that plasmids should be purged by negative selection regardless of whether they encoded beneficial accessory traits because these traits should eventually be captured by the chromosome, enabling the loss of the redundant plasmid. In the decade since the plasmid paradox was described, new data and theory show that a range of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms operate in bacterial populations and communities to explain the widespread distribution and stable maintenance of plasmids. We conclude, therefore, that multiple solutions to the plasmid paradox are now well understood. The current challenge for the field, however, is to better understand how these solutions operate in natural bacterial communities to explain and predict the distribution of plasmids and the dynamics of the horizontal gene transfer that they mediate in bacterial (pan)genomes."}

Acceptance is an indispensable prerequisite for the widespread implementation of AI. The aim of this integrative review is to explore barriers and facilitators influencing healthcare professionals' acceptance of AI in the hospital setting. Forty-two articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Pertinent elements to the study such as the type of AI, factors influencing acceptance, and the participants' profession were extracted from the included studies, and the studies were appraised for their quality. The data extraction and results were presented according to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The included studies revealed a variety of facilitating and hindering factors for AI acceptance in the hospital setting. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) were the AI form included in most studies (n = 21). Heterogeneous results with regard to the perceptions of the effects of AI on error occurrence, alert sensitivity and timely resources were reported. In contrast, fear of a loss of (professional) autonomy and difficulties in integrating AI into clinical workflows were unanimously reported to be hindering factors. On the other hand, training for the use of AI facilitated acceptance. Heterogeneous results may be explained by differences in the application and functioning of the different AI systems as well as inter-professional and interdisciplinary disparities. To conclude, in order to facilitate acceptance of AI among healthcare professionals it is advisable to integrate end-users in the early stages of AI development as well as to offer needs-adjusted training for the use of AI in healthcare and providing adequate infrastructure."}

However, tuning the dynamic persistent luminescence through molecular design and materials engineering remains a challenge. In this work, the first example of excitation-dependent persistent luminescence in a reverse mode for smart optical materials through tailoring the excited-state proton transfer process of metal cytosine halide hybrids is reported. This approach enables ultralong phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence emission colors highly tuned by modulation of excitation wavelength, time evolution, and temperature, which realize multi-mode dynamic color adjustment from green to blue or cyan to yellow-green. At the single crystal level, the 2D excitation/space/time-resolved optical waveguides with triple color conversion have been constructed on the organic-metal halide microsheets, which represent a new strategy for multi-dimensional information encryption and optical logic gate applications."}

These vesicles play a critical role in intercellular signaling networks during physiopathological processes through data trafficking and cell reprogramming. It has been demonstrated that exosomes are involved in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Exosome mediators' cell-to-cell communication is possibly by delivering their contents such as proteins, RNAs (coding and non-coding), DNAs (mitochondrial and genomic), and transposable elements to the target cells. Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) differ in their expression patterns in MS disease, thereby providing novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic options for better treatment of MS disease. Furthermore, these microvesicles are non-immunogenic and non-toxic therapeutic tools for transferring miRNAs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Collectively, exosomes could be used as novel drug delivery devices for the treatment of MS patients. This review summarized research regarding the exosomes from serum, plasma, PBMC, and other cells in MS patients and experimental models. We also provide a critical view of exosome content-mediated signaling pathways in MS, including TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, NF-kappa B, and Wnt pathways.

Several redox-relevant micronutrients are known to contribute to an adequate immune response, including the essential trace elements zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that COVID-19 patients are characterised by Zn deficiency and that Zn status provides prognostic information. Serum Zn was determined in serum samples (n = 171) collected consecutively from patients surviving COVID-19 (n = 29) or non-survivors (n = 6). Data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study were used for comparison. Zn concentrations in patient samples were low as compared to healthy subjects (mean +/- SD; 717.4 +/- 246.2 vs 975.7 +/- 294.0 mu g/L, P < 0.0001). The majority of serum samples collected at different time points from the non-survivors (25/34, i.e., 73.5%) and almost half of the samples collected from the survivors (56/137, i.e., 40.9%) were below the threshold for Zn deficiency, i.e., below 638.7 mu g/L (the 2.5th percentile in the EPIC cohort). In view that the Se status biomarker and Se transporter selenoprotein P (SELENOP) is also particularly low in COVID-19, we tested the prevalence of a combined deficit, i.e., serum Zn below 638.7 jig/L and serum SELENOP below 2.56 mg/L. This combined deficit was observed in 0.15% of samples in the EPIC cohort of healthy subjects, in 19.7% of the samples collected from the surviving COVID-19 patients and in 50.0% of samples from the non-survivors. Accordingly, the composite biomarker (SELENOP and Zn with age) proved as a reliable indicator of survival in COVID-19 by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 94.42%. We conclude that Zn and SELENOP status within the reference ranges indicate high survival odds in COVID-19, and assume that correcting a diagnostically proven deficit in Se and/or Zn by a personalised supplementation may support convalescence."}

The use of metal oxide nanoparticles is one of the promising ways for overcoming antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have found wide applications in different fields of biomedicine. Several studies have suggested using the antimicrobial potential of IONPs. Iron is one of the key microelements and plays an important role in the function of living systems of different hierarchies. Iron abundance and its physiological functions bring into question the ability of iron compounds at the same concentrations, on the one hand, to inhibit the microbial growth and, on the other hand, to positively affect mammalian cells. At present, multiple studies have been published that show the antimicrobial effect of IONPs against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. Several studies have established that IONPs have a low toxicity to eukaryotic cells. It gives hope that IONPs can be considered potential antimicrobial agents of the new generation that combine antimicrobial action and high biocompatibility with the human body. This review is intended to inform readers about the available data on the antimicrobial properties of IONPs, a range of susceptible bacteria, mechanisms of the antibacterial action, dependence of the antibacterial action of IONPs on the method for synthesis, and the biocompatibility of IONPs with eukaryotic cells and tissues."}

Cancer patients are typically associated with higher Cu content in serum and tumor tissues, indicating increased demand of cancer cells for this micronutrient. Cu is known to readily cycle between the +1 and +2 oxidation state in biological systems. The mechanism of action of Cu complexes is typically based on their redox activity and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to deadly oxidative stress. However, there are a number of other biomolecular mechanisms beyond ROS generation that contribute to the activity of anticancer Cu drug candidates. In this review, we discuss how interfering with intracellular Cu balance via either diet modification or addition of inorganic Cu supplements or Cu-modulating compounds affects tumor development, progression, and sensitivity to treatment modalities. We aim to provide the rationale for the use of Cu-depleting and Cu-overloading conditions to generate the best possible patient outcome with minimal toxicity. We also discuss the advantages of the use of pre-formed Cu complexes, such as Cu-(bis)thiosemicarbazones or Cu-N-heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones, in comparison with the in situ formed Cu complexes with metal-binding ligands. In this review, we summarize available clinical and mechanistic data on clinically relevant anticancer drug candidates, including Cu supplements, Cu chelators, Cu ionophores, and Cu complexes."}

This survey has built on existing HBM capacity in Europe by aligning national or regional HBM studies, referred to as the HBM4EU Aligned Studies. The HBM4EU Aligned Studies included a total of 10,795 participants of three age groups: (i) 3,576 children aged 6-12 years, (ii) 3,117 teenagers aged 12-18 years and (iii) 4,102 young adults aged 20-39 years. The participants were recruited between 2014 and 2021 in 11-12 countries per age group, geographically distributed across Europe. Depending on the age group, internal exposure to phthalates and the substitute DINCH, halogenated and organophosphorus flame retardants, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), cadmium, bisphenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), arsenic species, acrylamide, mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol (total DON)), benzophenones and selected pesticides was assessed by measuring substance specific biomarkers subjected to stringent quality control programs for chemical analysis. For substance groups analyzed in different age groups higher average exposure levels were observed in the youngest age group, i.e., phthalates/DINCH in children versus teenagers, acrylamide and pesticides in children versus adults, benzo-phenones in teenagers versus adults. Many biomarkers in teenagers and adults varied significantly according to educational attainment, with higher exposure levels of bisphenols, phthalates, benzophenones, PAHs and acrylamide in participants (from households) with lower educational attainment, while teenagers from house-holds with higher educational attainment have higher exposure levels for PFASs and arsenic. In children, a social gradient was only observed for the non-specific pyrethroid metabolite 3-PBA and di-isodecyl phthalate (DiDP), with higher levels in children from households with higher educational attainment. Geographical variations were seen for all exposure biomarkers. For 15 biomarkers, the available health-based HBM guidance values were exceeded with highest exceedance rates for toxicologically relevant arsenic in teenagers (40%), 3-PBA in children (36%), and between 11 and 14% for total DON, Sigma (PFOA + PFNA + PFHxS + PFOS), bisphenol S and cadmium. The infrastructure and harmonized approach succeeded in obtaining comparable European wide internal exposure data for a prioritized set of 11 chemical groups.

The medical and dental evidence-based era (1980-present) is contextualized with the earlier evidence drive in endodontics (1911-1940) triggered by the focal infection era. The current evidence-based approach has a sharper focus on evidence quality and derivation of practice guidelines. Contrary views question whether guideline-driven, or expertise-development-driven endeavours would best serve outcome improvement in society. The endodontic discipline functions in a broad healthcare framework and sustains industrial, economic and trend pressures that may be deemed to influence outcomes. The nature of root canal treatment and the challenges in determining the factors that affect its outcomes is discussed. The factors potentially affecting periapical healing after root canal treatment are classified into pre-operative, intra-operative and postoperative groups. These categories subsume multiple elements with interactive influences, creating a complex picture, further confounded by some apparently surprising, counter-intuitive and contradictory findings. The technical versus biological conundrum in root canal treatment continues to cause cognitive dissonance. However, due reflection and cross-discipline-synthesis resolve the apparent data conflicts into a very simple, consistent and plausible picture of how root canal treatment works and the key factors that affect periapical healing. Root canal retreatment is considered mainly in the context of its differences from primary treatment as the majority of factors influencing outcomes are common to both. The exceptional difference is that retreatments have a proportionately reduced probability of healing by virtue of compromised apical root canal ramification access or modified host/infection interactions. Root canal (re)treatment outcomes are dominantly influenced by the nature of prior dynamic host/infection interaction (pre-operative patient factors) and how the direction of this dynamic is influenced by two factors: (1) the active efficacy of the operators' root canal treatment protocol to sustain a microbial ecological shift (intra-operative treatment factors) and dampen periapical inflammation; and (2) the passive ability of the functional tooth (and its restoration margin) to maintain its integrity to resist infection reversal (postoperative restorative factors)."}

Given the lack of baseline randomization and measurement issues, concerns exist about whether such studies produce unbiased treatment effect estimates.OBJECTIVE To emulate the design of 30 completed and 2 ongoing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of medications with database studies using observational analogues of the RCT design parameters (population, intervention, comparator, outcome, time [PICOT]) and to quantify agreement in RCT-database study pairs.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS New-user cohort studies with propensity score matching using 3 US claims databases (Optum Clinformatics, MarketScan, and Medicare). Inclusion-exclusion criteria for each database study were prespecified to emulate the corresponding RCT. RCTs were explicitly selected based on feasibility, including power, key confounders, and end points more likely to be emulated with real-world data. All 32 protocols were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov before conducting analyses. Emulations were conducted from 2017 through 2022.EXPOSURES Therapies for multiple clinical conditions were included.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Database study emulations focused on the primary outcome of the corresponding RCT. Findings of database studies were compared with RCTs using predefined metrics, including Pearson correlation coefficients and binary metrics based on statistical significance agreement, estimate agreement, and standardized difference.RESULTS In these highly selected RCTs, the overall observed agreement between the RCT and the database emulation results was a Pearson correlation of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.64-0.91), with 75% meeting statistical significance, 66% estimate agreement, and 75% standardized difference agreement. In a post hoc analysis limited to 16 RCTs with closer emulation of trial design and measurements, concordance was higher (Pearson r, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-0.97; 94% meeting statistical significance, 88% estimate agreement, 88% standardized difference agreement). Weaker concordance occurred among 16 RCTs for which close emulation of certain design elements that define the research question (PICOT) with data from insurance claims was not possible (Pearson r, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.00-0.83; 56% meeting statistical significance, 50% estimate agreement, 69% standardized difference agreement). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Real-world evidence studies can reach similar conclusions as RCTs when design and measurements can be closely emulated, but this may be difficult to achieve. Concordance in results varied depending on the agreement metric. Emulation differences, chance, and residual confounding can contribute to divergence in results and are difficult to disentangle."}

This organism displays clonal dissemination and is able to accumulate resistance traits by horizontal gene transfer, natural transformation, acquisition of mutations, and mobilization of genetic elements that modulate gene expression.Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (CRAB) is one of the top-priority pathogens for new antibiotic development. Unlike other antibiotic-resistant threats, none of the available therapies have been shown to consistently reduce mortality or improve patient outcomes in clinical trials. Antibiotic combination therapy is routinely used in clinical practice; however, the preferred combination has not been defined. This narrative review focuses on evidence-based solutions for the treatment of invasive CRAB infections. We dissect the promise and perils of traditional agents used in combination, such as colistin, sulbactam, and the tetracyclines, and offer clinical pearls based on our interpretation of the available data. Next, we investigate the merits of newly developed beta-lactam agents like cefiderocol and sulbactam-durlobactam, which have demonstrated contrasting results in recent randomized clinical trials. The review concludes with the authors' perspective on the evolving treatment landscape for CRAB infections, which is complicated by limited clinical data, imperfect treatment options, and a need for future clinical trials. We propose that effective treatment for CRAB infections requires a personalized approach that incorporates host factors, the site of infection, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic principles, local molecular epidemiology of CRAB isolates, and careful interpretation of antibiotic susceptibility testing results. In most clinical scenarios, a dose-optimized, sulbactam-based regimen is recommended with the addition of at least one other in vitro active agent. Should sulbactam-durlobactam receive regulatory approval, recommendations will need to be re-evaluated with the most recent evidence."}

The meta-analysis (4594 participants) revealed that CR produced significant small-to-moderate size improvements in all domains of cognition studied (Hedge's gs = .19-.33). and a significant small improvement in function (Hedge's g = .21). CR programs that included a discussion (bridging) group to help apply acquired cognitive skills to everyday life produced larger effects on global cognition and verbal memory. CR programs with strategy-coaching produced larger effects on episodic memory. Sample age, gender, positive, negative, and overall symptoms, and medication dose did not serve as barriers to treatment gains. CR produces small-to-moderate improvements in cognition and function in schizophrenia. Programs of CR that utilize bridging groups and strategy-coaching are more cognitively potent. Future research should focus on ways to modify CR to bolster generalization of cognitive improvements to function."}

A complete understanding of this process requires a systematic characterization of cell states over the entire spatiotemporal range of brain development. The ability of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reveal the molecular heterogeneity of complex tissues has therefore been particularly powerful in the nervous system. Previous studies have explored development in specific brain regions(1-8), the whole adult brain(9) and even entire embryos(10). Here we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse brain between gastrulation and birth. We identified almost eight hundred cellular states that describe a developmental program for the functional elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes, including the early neuroepithelium, region-specific secondary organizers, and both neurogenic and gliogenic progenitors. We also used in situ mRNA sequencing to map the spatial expression patterns of key developmental genes. Integrating the in situ data with our single-cell clusters revealed the precise spatial organization of neural progenitors during the patterning of the nervous system.A comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the mouse brain between gastrulation and birth identifies hundreds of cellular states and reveals the spatiotemporal organization of brain development."}

In this study, the geometric and physical methods related to soft tissue modeling were investigated. Regarding geometric modeling, the problem of repeated inverse calculations of control points in the Bezier method was solved via re-parameterization, which improved the calculation speed. The base surface superposition method based on prior information was proposed to make the deformation model not only have the advantages of the Bezier method but also have the ability to fit local irregular deformation surfaces. Regarding physical modeling, the fitting ability of the particle spring model to the anisotropy of soft tissue was improved by optimizing the topological structure of the particle spring model. Then, the particle spring model had a more extensive nonlinear fitting ability through the dynamic elastic coefficient parameter. Finally, the secondary modeling of the elastic coefficient based on the virtual body spring enabled the model to fit the creep and relaxation characteristics of biological tissue according to the elongation of the virtual body spring."}

Corresponding authors of the identified publications were invited to provide feedback on the initial APOSTEL recommendations via online surveys following the principle of a modified Delphi method. The results were evaluated and discussed by a panel of experts and changes to the initial recommendations were proposed. A final survey was recirculated among the corresponding authors to obtain a majority vote on the proposed changes.ResultsA total of 116 authors participated in the surveys, resulting in 15 suggestions, of which 12 were finally accepted and incorporated into an updated 9-point checklist. We harmonized the nomenclature of the outer retinal layers, added the exact area of measurement to the description of volume scans, and suggested reporting device-specific features. We advised to address potential bias in manual segmentation or manual correction of segmentation errors. References to specific reporting guidelines and room light conditions were removed. The participants' consensus with the recommendations increased from 80% for the previous APOSTEL version to greater than 90%.ConclusionsThe modified Delphi method resulted in an expert-led guideline (evidence Class III; Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations [GRADE] criteria) concerning study protocol, acquisition device, acquisition settings, scanning protocol, funduscopic imaging, postacquisition data selection, postacquisition analysis, nomenclature and abbreviations, and statistical approach.

Consequently, NWNs may also emulate the synaptic processes that enable higher-order cognitive functions such as learning and memory. A quintessential cognitive task used to measure human working memory is the n-back task. In this study, task variations inspired by the n-back task are implemented in a NWN device, and external feedback is applied to emulate brain-like supervised and reinforcement learning. NWNs are found to retain information in working memory to at least n = 7 steps back, remarkably similar to the originally proposed seven plus or minus two rule for human subjects. Simulations elucidate how synapse-like NWN junction plasticity depends on previous synaptic modifications, analogous to synaptic metaplasticity in the brain, and how memory is consolidated via strengthening and pruning of synaptic conductance pathways."}

As de novo genomes are being generated for all known eukaryotic species as advocated by the Earth BioGenome Project, increasing genomic information on green land plants is essential. However, setting standards for the generation and storage of the complex set of genomes that characterize the green lineage of life is a major challenge for plant scientists. Such standards will need to accommodate the immense variation in green plant genome size, transposable element content, and structural complexity while enabling research into the molecular and evolutionary processes that have resulted in this enormous genomic variation. Here we provide an overview and assessment of the current state of knowledge of green plant genomes. To date fewer than 300 complete chromosome-scale genome assemblies representing fewer than 900 species have been generated across the estimated 450,000 to 500,000 species in the green plant clade. These genomes range in size from 12 Mb to 27.6 Gb and are biased toward agricultural crops with large branches of the green tree of life untouched by genomic-scale sequencing. Locating suitable tissue samples of most species of plants, especially those taxa from extreme environments, remains one of the biggest hurdles to increasing our genomic inventory. Furthermore, the annotation of plant genomes is at present undergoing intensive improvement. It is our hope that this fresh overview will help in the development of genomic quality standards for a cohesive and meaningful synthesis of green plant genomes as we scale up for the future."}

{"id": "WOS_81", "text": "Artificial intelligence technologies and compassion in healthcare: A systematic scoping review Background: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, together with the availability of big data in society, creates uncertainties about how these developments will affect healthcare systems worldwide. Compassion is essential for high-quality healthcare and research shows how prosocial caring behaviors benefit human health and societies. However, the possible association between AI technologies and compassion is under conceptualized and underexplored. Objectives: The aim of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive depth and a balanced perspective of the emerging topic of AI technologies and compassion, to inform future research and practice. The review questions were: How is compassion discussed in relation to AI technologies in healthcare? How are AI technologies being used to enhance compassion in healthcare? What are the gaps in current knowledge and unexplored potential? What are the key areas where AI technologies could support compassion in healthcare? Materials and methods: A systematic scoping review following five steps of Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Presentation of the scoping review conforms with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). Eligibility criteria were defined according to 3 concept constructs (AI technologies, compassion, healthcare) developed from the literature and informed by medical subject headings (MeSH) and key words for the electronic searches. Sources of evidence were Web of Science and PubMed databases, articles published in English language 2011-2022. Articles were screened by title/abstract using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data extracted (author, date of publication, type of article, aim/context of healthcare, key relevant findings, country) was charted using data tables. Thematic analysis used an inductive-deductive approach to generate code categories from the review questions and the data. A multidisciplinary team assessed themes for resonance and relevance to research and practice. Results: Searches identified 3,124 articles. A total of 197 were included after screening. The number of articles has increased over 10 years (2011, n = 1 to 2021, n = 47 and from Jan-Aug 2022 n = 35 articles). Overarching themes related to the review questions were: (1) Developments and debates (7 themes) Concerns about AI ethics, healthcare jobs, and loss of empathy; Human-centered design of AI technologies for healthcare; Optimistic speculation AI technologies will address care gaps; Interrogation of what it means to be human and to care; Recognition of future potential for patient monitoring, virtual proximity, and access to healthcare; Calls for curricula development and healthcare professional education; Implementation of AI applications to enhance health and wellbeing of the healthcare workforce. (2) How AI technologies enhance compassion (10 themes) Empathetic awareness; Empathetic response and relational behavior; Communication skills; Health coaching; Therapeutic interventions; Moral development learning; Clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; Healthcare quality assessment; Therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; Providing health information and advice. (3) Gaps in knowledge (4 themes) Educational effectiveness of AI-assisted learning; Patient diversity and AI technologies; Implementation of AI technologies in education and practice settings; Safety and clinical effectiveness of AI technologies.(4) Key areas for development (3 themes) Enriching education, learning and clinical practice; Extending healing spaces; Enhancing healing relationships. Conclusion: There is an association between AI technologies and compassion in healthcare and interest in this association has grown internationally over the last decade. In a range of healthcare contexts, AI technologies are being used to enhance empathetic awareness; empathetic response and relational behavior; communication skills; health coaching; therapeutic interventions; moral development learning; clinical knowledge and clinical assessment; healthcare quality assessment; therapeutic bond and therapeutic alliance; and to provide health information and advice. The findings inform a reconceptualization of compassion as a human-AI system of intelligent caring comprising six elements: (1) Awareness of suffering (e.g., pain, distress, risk, disadvantage); (2) Understanding the suffering (significance, context, rights, responsibilities etc.); (3) Connecting with the suffering (e.g., verbal, physical, signs and symbols); (4) Making a judgment about the suffering (the need to act); (5) Responding with an intention to alleviate the suffering; (6) Attention to the effect and outcomes of the response. These elements can operate at an individual (human or machine) and collective systems level (healthcare organizations or systems) as a cyclical system to alleviate different types of suffering. New and novel approaches to human-AI intelligent caring could enrich education, learning, and clinical practice; extend healing spaces; and enhance healing relationships. Implications: In a complex adaptive system such as healthcare, human-AI intelligent caring will need to be implemented, not as an ideology, but through strategic choices, incentives, regulation, professional education, and training, as well as through joined up thinking about human-AI intelligent caring. Research funders can encourage research and development into the topic of AI technologies and compassion as a system of human-AI intelligent caring. Educators, technologists, and health professionals can inform themselves about the system of human-AI intelligent caring."}

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that elevated auxin levels in the rice dao mutant cause increased accumulation of sucrose in the photosynthetic leaves but reduced sucrose content in the reproductive organs (particularly in the lodicules, anthers, and ovaries), leading to closed spikelets, indehiscent anthers, and parthenocarpic seeds. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the expression of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 18 (OsARF18) and OsARF2 is significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the lodicule of dao mutant. Overexpression of OsARF18 or knocking out of OsARF2 phenocopies the dao mutant. We demonstrate that OsARF2 regulates the expression of OsSUT1 through direct binding to the sugar-responsive elements (SuREs) in the OsSUT1 promoter and that OsARF18 represses the expression of OsARF2 and OsSUT1 via direct binding to the auxin-responsive element (AuxRE) or SuRE in their promoters, respectively. Furthermore, overexpression of OsSUT1 in the dao and Osarf2 mutant backgrounds could largely rescue the spikelets' opening and seed-setting defects. Collectively, our results reveal an auxin signaling cascade regulating source-sink carbohydrate partitioning and reproductive organ development in rice."}

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical implications of COVID-19 cardiac involvement in young competitive athletes. Methods: In this prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study with data from 42 colleges and universities, we assessed the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19 cardiac involvement among collegiate athletes in the United States. Data were collected from September 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was the prevalence of definite, probable, or possible COVID-19 cardiac involvement based on imaging definitions adapted from the Updated Lake Louise Imaging Criteria. Secondary outcomes included the diagnostic yield of cardiac testing, predictors for cardiac involvement, and adverse cardiovascular events or hospitalizations. Results: Among 19 378 athletes tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 3018 (mean age, 20 years [SD, 1 year]; 32% female) tested positive and underwent cardiac evaluation. A total of 2820 athletes underwent at least 1 element of cardiac triad testing (12-lead ECG, troponin, transthoracic echocardiography) followed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) if clinically indicated. In contrast, primary screening CMR was performed in 198 athletes. Abnormal findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement were detected by ECG (21 of 2999 [0.7%]), cardiac troponin (24 of 2719 [0.9%]), and transthoracic echocardiography (24 of 2556 [0.9%]). Definite, probable, or possible SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement was identified in 21 of 3018 (0.7%) athletes, including 15 of 2820 (0.5%) who underwent clinically indicated CMR (n=119) and 6 of 198 (3.0%) who underwent primary screening CMR. Accordingly, the diagnostic yield of CMR for SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement was 4.2 times higher for a clinically indicated CMR (15 of 119 [12.6%]) versus a primary screening CMR (6 of 198 [3.0%]). After adjustment for race and sex, predictors of SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement included cardiopulmonary symptoms (odds ratio, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.2, 7.7]) or at least 1 abnormal triad test result (odds ratio, 37.4 [95% CI, 13.3, 105.3]). Five (0.2%) athletes required hospitalization for noncardiac complications of COVID-19. During clinical surveillance (median follow-up, 113 days [interquartile range=90 146]), there was 1 (0.03%) adverse cardiac event, likely unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection among young competitive athletes is associated with a low prevalence of cardiac involvement and a low risk of clinical events in short-term follow-up."}

Colonization with butyrate -producing bacteria or treatment with butyrate suppressed this effect and reduced intestinal histone deacetylase activity. Epithelial -intrinsic deletion of the epigenetic -modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibited tuft cell expansion in vivo and impaired type 2 immune responses during helminth infection. Butyrate restricted stem cell differentiation into tuft cells, and inhibition of HDAC3 in adult mice and human intestinal organoids blocked tuft cell expansion.

FAPROTAX is a promising tool for predicting ecological relevant functions of bacterial and archaeal taxa derived from 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The database was initially developed to predict the function of marine species using standard microbiological references. This study, however, has attempted to access the application of FAPROTAX in soil environments. We hypothesized that FAPROTAX was compatible with terrestrial ecosystems. The potential use of FAPROTAX to assign ecological functions of soil bacteria was investigated using meta-analysis and our newly designed experiments. Soil samples from two major terrestrial ecosystems, including agricultural land and forest, were collected. Bacterial taxonomy was analyzed using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and ecological functions of the soil bacteria were assigned by FAPROTAX. The presence of all functionally assigned OTUs (Operation Taxonomic Units) in soil were manually checked using peer-reviewed articles as well as standard microbiology books. Overall, we showed that sample source was not a predominant factor that limited the application of FAPROTAX, but poor taxonomic identification was. The proportion of assigned taxa between aquatic and non-aquatic ecosystems was not significantly different (p > 0.05). There were strong and significant correlations (sigma = 0.90-0.95, p < 0.01) between the number of OTUs assigned to genus or order level and the number of functionally assigned OTUs. After manual verification, we found that more than 97% of the FAPROTAX assigned OTUs have previously been detected and potentially performed functions in agricultural and forest soils. We further provided information regarding taxa capable of N-fixation, P and K solubilization, which are three main important elements in soil systems and can be integrated with FAPROTAX to increase the proportion of functionally assigned OTUs. Consequently, we concluded that FAPROTAX can be used for a fast-functional screening or grouping of 16S derived bacterial data from terrestrial ecosystems and its performance could be enhanced through improving the taxonomic and functional reference databases."}
{"id": "WOS_89", "text": "Mixture risk assessment and human biomonitoring: Lessons learnt from HBM4EU Unintentional chemical mixtures that are present in the environment are of societal concern as the (environmental) chemicals contained therein, either singly or in combination, may possess properties that are hazardous (toxic) for human health. The current regulatory practice, however, is still largely based on evaluating single chemical substances one-by-one. Over the years various research efforts have delivered tools and approaches for risk assessment of chemical mixtures, but many of these were not considered sufficiently mature for regulatory implementation. This is (partly) due to mixture risk assessment (MRA) being very complex because of the large number of chemicals present in the environment. A key element in risk assessment is information on actual exposures in the population of interest. To date, information on actual personal (internal) mixture exposures is largely absent, severely limiting MRA. The use of human biomonitoring data may improve this situation. Therefore, we investigated within the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU) various approaches to assess combined exposures and MRA. Based on the insights and lessons learnt in the context of the HBM4EU project, conclusions as well as recommendations for policy development regarding chemical mixtures and for further research were drafted. These conclusions and recommendations relate to both exposure and adverse health effects in humans. The recommendations were discussed with stakeholders in a workshop held in October 2021. There was considerable support and agreement with the spirit, scope and intention of the draft recommendations. Here we describe the lessons learnt on mixture risk assessment through the HBM4EU project and present the final recommendations. Overall, HBM4EU results demonstrated the potential of human biomonitoring as an instrument to obtain insight into the real-life mixtures the human population is exposed to. Also, HBM4EU results demonstrated that chemical mixtures are of public health concern. In the majority of the cases, it was possible to identify risk drivers, i.e. chemicals that contribute more strongly than others to the health risk. The novel approaches to identify co-occurrence patterns demonstrated clusters of co-occurring chemicals; chemicals in these mixture clusters are regulated independently under different legislative frameworks. Moreover, HBM4EU data and expertise can support a science-based derivation of a Mixture Assessment Factor and gauge potential impacts on the population's exposure to chemicals. While further expansion is needed on various aspects of the mixture activities carried out in the context of HBM4EU, application of available methodologies for mixture risk assessment should already be implemented to the degree possible."}

OS-related genes can be affected by environmental factors, intestinal inflammation, gut microbiota, and epigenetic changes. However, the role of OS as a potential CD etiological factor or triggering factor is unknown, as differentially expressed OS genes in CD can be either a cause or a subsequent change of intestinal inflammation. Herein, we used a multi-omics summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) approach to identify putative causal effects and underlying mechanisms of OS genes in CD.MethodsOS-related genes were extracted from the GeneCards database. Intestinal transcriptome datasets were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and meta-analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to OS in CD. Integration analyses of the largest CD genome-wide association study (GWAS) summaries with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and DNA methylation QTLs (mQTLs) from the blood were performed using SMR methods to prioritize putative blood OS genes and their regulatory elements associated with CD risk. Up-to-date intestinal eQTLs and fecal microbial QTLs (mbQTLs) were integrated to uncover potential interactions between host OS gene expression and gut microbiota through SMR and colocalization analysis. Two additional Mendelian randomization (MR) methods were used as sensitivity analyses. Putative results were validated in an independent multi-omics cohort from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (FAH-SYS).ResultsA meta-analysis from six datasets identified 438 OS-related DEGs enriched in intestinal enterocytes in CD from 817 OS-related genes. Five genes from blood tissue were prioritized as candidate CD-causal genes using three-step SMR methods: BAD, SHC1, STAT3, MUC1, and GPX3. Furthermore, SMR analysis also identified five putative intestinal genes, three of which were involved in gene-microbiota interactions through colocalization analysis: MUC1, CD40, and PRKAB1. Validation results showed that 88.79% of DEGs were replicated in the FAH-SYS cohort. Associations between pairs of MUC1-Bacillus aciditolerans and PRKAB1-Escherichia coli in the FAH-SYS cohort were consistent with eQTL-mbQTL colocalization.ConclusionsThis multi-omics integration study highlighted that OS genes causal to CD are regulated by DNA methylation and host-microbiota interactions. This provides evidence for future targeted functional research aimed at developing suitable therapeutic interventions and disease prevention."}

Murine models were generated through hydrodynamic tail vein injection and compared with the human disease.Results iCCA is composed of five robust STIM classes encompassing both inflamed (35%) and non-inflamed profiles (65%). The inflamed classes, named immune classical (similar to 10%) and inflammatory stroma (similar to 25%), differ in oncogenic pathways and extent of desmoplasia, with the inflammatory stroma showing T cell exhaustion, abundant stroma and KRAS mutations (p<0.001). Analysis of cell-cell interactions highlights cancer-associated fibroblast subtypes as potential mediators of immune evasion. Among the non-inflamed classes, the desert-like class (similar to 20%) harbours the lowest immune infiltration with abundant regulatory T cells (p<0.001), whereas the hepatic stem-like class (similar to 35%) is enriched in 'M2-like' macrophages, mutations in IDH1/2 and BAP1, and FGFR2 fusions. The remaining class (tumour classical: similar to 10%) is defined by cell cycle pathways and poor prognosis. Comparative analysis unveils high similarity between a KRAS/p19 murine model and the inflammatory stroma class (p=0.02). The KRAS-SOS inhibitor, BI3406, sensitises a KRAS-mutant iCCA murine model to anti-PD1 therapy.Conclusions We describe a comprehensive TME-based stratification of iCCA. Cross-species analysis establishes murine models that align closely to human iCCA for the preclinical testing of combination strategies."}

Based on the traditional near-infrared region I (NIR-I), the molecular probe of the near-infrared region II (NIR-II) is further explored and developed. In the NIR-II region due to the wavelength is longer than the NIR-I region can effectively reduce the molecular scattering, optical absorption of the organization, the organization of spontaneous fluorescence negligible, thus the NIR-II Fluorescence imaging (FI) can get deeper penetration depth, higher signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and better spatiotemporal resolution, FI in NIR-II region are an important and rapidly developing research region for future imaging. In the NIR-II fluorophore, small organic molecule fluorophore has attracted much attention because of its good biocompatibility and good pharmacokinetic properties. In this review, we briefly introduced the existing NIR-II organic small molecule fluorophores, and introduced the existing relatively mature methods for improving quantum yield and water solubility, and the small molecule dyes on FI of various improvement methods, also briefly introduces the small molecules of photoacoustic imaging (PAI), and a brief introduction of imaging-guided surgery (IGS) for some small organic molecules, finally, a reasonable prospect is made for the development of small organic molecules."}
{"id": "WOS_93", "text": "The interplay between the circadian clock and abiotic stress responses mediated by ABF3 and CCA1/LHY Climate change is a global concern for all life on our planet, including humans and plants. Plants' growth and development are significantly affected by abiotic stresses, including adverse temperature, inadequate or excess water availability, nutrient deficiency, and salinity. The circadian clock is a master regulator of numerous developmental and metabolic processes in plants. In an effort to identify new clock- related genes and outputs through bioinformatic analysis, we have revealed that CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) play a crucial role in regulating a wide range of abiotic stress responses and target ABSCISIC ACID RESPONSIVE ELEMENTS- BINDING FACTOR3 (ABF3), a key transcription factor in the plant hormone Abscisic acid (ABA)- signaling pathway. Specifically, we found that CCA1 and LHY regulate the expression ofABF3 under diel conditions, as well as seed germination under salinity. Conversely, ABF3 controls the expression of core clock genes and orchestrates the circadian period in a stress- responsive manner. ABF3 delivers the stress signal to the central oscillator by binding to the promoter of CCA1 and LHY. Overall, our study uncovers the reciprocal regulation between ABF3 and CCA1/LHY and molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between the circadian clock and abiotic stress. This finding may aid in developing molecular and genetic solutions for plants to survive and thrive in the face of climate change."}

Neuromorphic computing is an effective and essential solution towards spike-based machine intelligence and neural learning systems. However, on-line learning capability for neuromorphic models is still an open challenge. In this study a novel neuromorphic architecture with dendritic on-line learning (NADOL) is presented, which is a novel efficient methodology for brain-inspired intelligence on embedded hardware. With the feature of distributed processing using spiking neural network, NADOL can cut down the power consumption and enhance the learning efficiency and convergence speed. A detailed analysis for NADOL is presented, which demonstrates the effects of different conditions on learning capabilities, including neuron number in hidden layer, dendritic segregation parameters, feedback connection, and connection sparseness with various levels of amplification. Piecewise linear approximation approach is used to cut down the computational resource cost. The experimental results demonstrate a remarkable learning capability that surpasses other solutions, with NADOL exhibiting superior performance over the GPU platform in dendritic learning. This study's applicability extends across diverse domains, including the Internet of Things, robotic control, and brain-machine interfaces.

Here we present EpiMap, a compendium comprising 10,000 epigenomic maps across 800 samples, which we used to define chromatin states, high-resolution enhancers, enhancer modules, upstream regulators and downstream target genes. We used this resource to annotate 30,000 genetic loci that were associated with 540 traits(4), predicting trait-relevant tissues, putative causal nucleotide variants in enriched tissue enhancers and candidate tissue-specific target genes for each. We partitioned multifactorial traits into tissue-specific contributing factors with distinct functional enrichments and disease comorbidity patterns, and revealed both single-factor monotropic and multifactor pleiotropic loci. Top-scoring loci frequently had multiple predicted driver variants, converging through multiple enhancers with a common target gene, multiple genes in common tissues, or multiple genes and multiple tissues, indicating extensive pleiotropy. Our results demonstrate the importance of dense, rich, high-resolution epigenomic annotations for the investigation of complex traits."}

Multilayer perceptron neuron network (MLPNN), Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) were used as base learners, which were then combined with bagging and Adaboost methods to improve the predictive performance. In addition, gene expression programming (GEP) was used to develop computational equations that can be used to predict the CS and FS of plastic concrete. An extensive database containing 357 and 125 data points was obtained from the literature, and the eight most impactful ingredients were used in the model's development. The accuracy of all models was assessed using several statistical measures, including an error matrix, Akaike information criterion (AIC), K-fold cross-validation, and other external validation equations. Furthermore, sensitivity and SHAP analysis were performed to evaluate input variables' relative significance and impact on the anticipated CS and FS. Based on statistical measures and other validation criteria, GEP outpaces all other individual models, whereas, in ELAs, the SVR ensemble with Adaboost and RF modified with the Bagging technique demonstrated superior performance. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and sensitivity analysis reveal that plastic, cement, water, and the age of the specimens have the highest influence, while superplasticizer has the lowest impact, which is consistent with experimental studies. Moreover, GUI and GEP-based simple mathematical correlation can enhance the practical scope of this study and be an effective tool for the pre-mix design of plastic concrete."}

Epidemiological data and observational reports from both the original SARS epidemic and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic have a common feature: males are more likely to exhibit enhanced disease severity and mortality than females. Sex differences in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 share mechanistic foundations, namely, the involvement of both the innate immune system and the canonical renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Immunological differences suggest that females mount a rapid and aggressive innate immune response, and the attenuated antiviral response in males may confer enhanced susceptibility to severe disease. Furthermore, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is involved in disease pathogenesis in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, either to serve as a protective mechanism by deactivating the RAS or as the receptor for viral entry, respectively. Loss of membrane ACE2 and a corresponding increase in plasma ACE2 are associated with worsened cardiovascular disease outcomes, a mechanism attributed to a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM17). SARS-CoV-2 infection also leads to ADAM17 activation, a positive feedback cycle that exacerbates ACE2 loss. Therefore, the relationship between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 is critically dependent on the loss of membrane ACE2 by ADAM17-mediated proteolytic cleavage. This article explores potential mechanisms involved in COVID-19 that may contribute to sex-specific susceptibility focusing on the innate immune system and the RAS, namely, genetics and sex hormones. Finally, we highlight here the added challenges of gender in the COVID-19 pandemic."}

However, there has been little direct evidence of any association due to the paucity of longitudinal studies reporting mental health before and during the lockdown. This present study provides the first longitudinal examination of changes in childhood mental health, a key component of an urgently needed evidence base that can inform policy and practice surrounding the continuing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods Mental health assessments on 168 children (aged 7.6-11.6 years) were taken before and during the UK lockdown (April-June 2020). Assessments included self-reports, caregiver reports, and teacher reports. Mean mental health scores before and during the UK lockdown were compared using mixed linear models.Results A significant increase in depression symptoms during the UK lockdown was observed, as measured by the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) short form. CIs suggest a medium-to-large effect size. There were no significant changes in the RCADS anxiety subscale and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional problems subscale.Conclusions During the UK lockdown, children's depression symptoms have increased substantially, relative to before lockdown. The scale of this effect has direct relevance for the continuation of different elements of lockdown policy, such as complete or partial school closures. This early evidence for the direct impact of lockdown must now be combined with larger scale epidemiological studies that establish which children are most at risk and tracks their future recovery."}

Here we show that the packaging of mRNA into leucocyte-derived EVs and the endocytosis of the EVs by neurons can be enhanced by engineering leucocytes to produce EVs that incorporate retrovirus-like mRNA-packaging capsids. We transfected immortalized and primary bone-marrow-derived leucocytes with DNA or RNA encoding the capsid-forming activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) protein as well as capsid-stabilizing Arc 5'-untranslated-region RNA elements. These engineered EVs inherit endothelial adhesion molecules from donor leukocytes, recruit endogenous enveloping proteins to their surface, cross the BBB, and enter the neurons in neuro-inflammatory sites. Produced from self-derived donor leukocytes, the EVs are immunologically inert, and enhanced the neuronal uptake of the packaged mRNA in a mouse model of low-grade chronic neuro-inflammation.The delivery of mRNAs into neurons at inflammatory sites in vivo can be enhanced by engineering leucocytes to produce extracellular vesicles incorporating mRNA-packaging retrovirus-like capsids."}

ObjectiveTo formulate EULAR points to consider (PtC) for the development of data-driven guidance and consensus for clinical trials and clinical practice in the field of prevention or interception of PsA and for clinical management of people with PsO at risk for PsA development. MethodsA multidisciplinary EULAR task force of 30 members from 13 European countries was established, and the EULAR standardised operating procedures for development for PtC were followed. Two systematic literature reviews were conducted to support the task force in formulating the PtC. Furthermore, the task force proposed nomenclature for the stages before PsA, through a nominal group process to be used in clinical trials. ResultsNomenclature for the stages preceding PsA onset, 5 overarching principles and 10 PtC were formulated. Nomenclature was proposed for three stages towards PsA development, namely people with PsO at higher risk of PsA, subclinical PsA and clinical PsA. The latter stage was defined as PsO and associated synovitis and it could be used as an outcome measure for clinical trials evaluating the transition from PsO to PsA. The overarching principles address the nature of PsA at its onset and underline the importance of collaboration of rheumatologists and dermatologists for strategies for prevention/interception of PsA. The 10 PtC highlight arthralgia and imaging abnormalities as key elements of subclinical PsA that can be used as potential short-term predictors of PsA development and useful items to design clinical trials for PsA interception. Traditional risk factors for PsA development (ie, PsO severity, obesity and nail involvement) may represent more long-term disease predictors and be less robust for short-term trials concerning the transition from PsO to PsA. ConclusionThese PtC are helpful to define the clinical and imaging features of people with PsO suspicious to progress to PsA. This information will be helpful for identification of those who could benefit from a therapeutic intervention to attenuate, delay or prevent PsA development."}

New insights into beneficial interactions Background: Research on beneficial mechanisms by plant-associated microbiomes, such as plant growth stimulation and protection from plant pathogens, has gained considerable attention over the past dec-ades; however, the mechanisms used by plants to recruit their microbiome is largely unknown. Aim of Review: Here, we review the latest studies that have begun to reveal plant strategies in selectively recruiting beneficial microbiomes, and how they manage to exclude potential pathogens. Key Scientific concepts of Review: We examine how plants attract beneficial microbiota from the main areas of interaction, such as the rhizosphere, endosphere, and phyllosphere, and demonstrate that such process occurs by producing root exudates, and recognizing molecules produced by the beneficial micro -biota or distinguishing pathogens using specific receptors, or by triggering signals that support plant-microbiome homeostasis. Second, we analyzed the main environmental or biotic factors that modulate the structure and successional dynamics of microbial communities. Finally, we review how the asso-ciated microbiome is capable of engaging with other synergistic microbes, hence providing an additional element of selection. Collectively, this study reveals the importance of understanding the complex net-work of plant interactions, which will improve the understanding of bioinoculant application in agricul-ture, based on a microbiome that interacts efficiently with plant organs under different environmental conditions.

The prevalence of childhood stunting has fallen, and linear growth faltering in early life has become less pronounced over time, markedly in middle-income countries but less so in low-income countries. Stunting and wasting remain public health problems in low-income countries, where 4.7% of children are simultaneously affected by both, a condition associated with a 4.8-times increase in mortality. New evidence shows that stunting and wasting might already be present at birth, and that the incidence of both conditions peaks in the first 6 months of life. Global low birthweight prevalence declined slowly at about 1.0% a year. Knowledge has accumulated on the short-term and long-term consequences of child undernutrition and on its adverse effect on adult human capital. Existing data on vitamin A deficiency among children suggest persisting high prevalence in Africa and south Asia. Zinc deficiency affects close to half of all children in the few countries with data. New evidence on the causes of poor growth points towards subclinical inflammation and environmental enteric dysfunction. Among women of reproductive age, the prevalence of low body-mass index has been reduced by half in middle-income countries, but trends in short stature prevalence are less evident. Both conditions are associated with poor outcomes for mothers and their children, whereas data on gestational weight gain are scarce. Data on the micronutrient status of women are conspicuously scarce, which constitutes an unacceptable data gap. Prevalence of anaemia in women remains high and unabated in many countries. Social inequalities are evident for many forms of undernutrition in women and children, suggesting a key role for poverty and low education, and reinforcing the need for multisectoral actions to accelerate progress. Despite little progress in some areas, maternal and child undernutrition remains a major global health concern, particularly as improvements since 2000 might be offset by the COVID-19 pandemic."}

However, missing from these measurements is the ability to routinely and easily spatially localize these profiled cells. We developed a strategy, Slide-tags, in which single nuclei within an intact tissue section are tagged with spatial barcode oligonucleotides derived from DNA-barcoded beads with known positions. These tagged nuclei can then be used as an input into a wide variety of single-nucleus profiling assays. Application of Slide-tags to the mouse hippocampus positioned nuclei at less than 10 mu m spatial resolution and delivered whole-transcriptome data that are indistinguishable in quality from ordinary single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data. To demonstrate that Slide-tags can be applied to a wide variety of human tissues, we performed the assay on brain, tonsil and melanoma. We revealed cell-type-specific spatially varying gene expression across cortical layers and spatially contextualized receptor-ligand interactions driving B cell maturation in lymphoid tissue. A major benefit of Slide-tags is that it is easily adaptable to almost any single-cell measurement technology. As a proof of principle, we performed multiomic measurements of open chromatin, RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequences in the same cells from metastatic melanoma, identifying transcription factor motifs driving cancer cell state transitions in spatially distinct microenvironments. Slide-tags offers a universal platform for importing the compendium of established single-cell measurements into the spatial genomics repertoire.Slide-tags enables multiomic sequencing of single cells and their localization within tissues."}

The basolateral amygdala is a centre of salience networks that underlie emotional experiences and thus has a key role in long-term fear memory formation1. Here we used spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to illuminate the cellular and molecular architecture of the role of the basolateral amygdala in long-term memory. We identified transcriptional signatures in subpopulations of neurons and astrocytes that were memory-specific and persisted for weeks. These transcriptional signatures implicate neuropeptide and BDNF signalling, MAPK and CREB activation, ubiquitination pathways, and synaptic connectivity as key components of long-term memory. Notably, upon long-term memory formation, a neuronal subpopulation defined by increased Penk and decreased Tac expression constituted the most prominent component of the memory engram of the basolateral amygdala. These transcriptional changes were observed both with single-cell RNA sequencing and with single-molecule spatial transcriptomics in intact slices, thereby providing a rich spatial map of a memory engram. The spatial data enabled us to determine that this neuronal subpopulation interacts with adjacent astrocytes, and functional experiments show that neurons require interactions with astrocytes to encode long-term memory.Spatial and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of the mouse basolateral amygdala reveal transcriptomic signatures, spatial resolution and interactions of cells that constitute the memory engram, including crucial neuron-astrocyte interactions."}

Compared with 7DDRs, SFFQs underestimated energy intake, macronutrients, and sodium intake but overestimated some micronutrients. The mean of the Spearman correlation coefficients was 0.66 (range, 0.38-0.88) between 46 energy-adjusted nutrients estimated from 7DDRs and the final SFFQ, deattenuated for within-person variation in the 7DDRs. These deattenuated correlations were similar using ASA24s as the comparison. Relative to biomarkers, SFFQs underestimated energy, sodium, and protein intakes, as well as the sodium:potassium ratio. The energy-adjusted correlations between the final SFFQ and the biomarkers were slightly lower than the correlations between the SFFQ and 7DDRs. Using the method of triads to calculate validity coefficients, the median validity coefficient between SFFQ and true intake was 0.65 and 0.69 using 7DDRs and ASA24s, respectively, as the third method. These data indicate that this SFFQ provided reasonably valid estimates for a wide range of nutrients when evaluated by multiple comparison methods."}

Furthermore, the early emergence of psychopathology contributes to a lifelong course of challenges across a broad set of functional domains, so addressing this early in the life course is essential. With increasing digital connectivity, including in low- and middle-income countries, digital health technologies are considered promising for addressing mental health among adolescents and young people. In recent years, a growing number of digital health interventions, including more than 2 million web-based mental health apps, have been developed to address a range of mental health issues.Objective: This review aims to synthesize the current evidence on digital health interventions targeting adolescents and young people with mental health conditions, aged between 10-24 years, with a focus on effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and generalizability to low-resource settings (eg, low- and middle-income countries).Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases between January 2010 and June 2020 for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on digital mental health interventions targeting adolescents and young people aged between 10-24 years. Two authors independently screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the reviews.Results: In this systematic overview, we included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We found evidence on the effectiveness of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy on anxiety and depression, whereas the effectiveness of other digital mental health interventions remains inconclusive. Interventions with an in-person element with a professional, peer, or parent were associated with greater effectiveness, adherence, and lower dropout than fully automatized or self-administered interventions. Despite the proposed utility of digital interventions for increasing accessibility of treatment across settings, no study has reported sample-specific metrics of social context (eg, socioeconomic background) or focused on low-resource settings.Conclusions: Although digital interventions for mental health can be effective for both supplementing and supplanting traditional mental health treatment, only a small proportion of existing digital platforms are evidence based. Furthermore, their cost-effectiveness and effectiveness, including in low- and middle-income countries, have been understudied. Widespread adoption and scale-up of digital mental health interventions, especially in settings with limited resources for health, will require more rigorous and consistent demonstrations of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness vis-a-vis the type of service provided, target population, and the current standard of care."}

Malnutrition is common and may also contribute to the development of the geriatric syndromes in older adults. Malnutrition in the old is reflected by either involuntary weight loss or low body mass index, but hidden deficiencies such as micronutrient deficiencies are more difficult to assess and therefore frequently overlooked in the community-dwelling old. In developed countries, the most cited cause of malnutrition is disease, as both acute and chronic disorders have the potential to result in or aggravate malnutrition. Therefore, as higher age is one risk factor for developing disease, older adults have the highest risk of being at nutritional risk or becoming malnourished. However, the aetiology of malnutrition is complex and multifactorial, and the development of malnutrition in the old is most likely also facilitated by ageing processes. This comprehensive narrative review summarizes current evidence on the prevalence and determinants of malnutrition in old adults spanning from age-related changes to disease-associated risk factors, and outlines remaining challenges in the understanding, identification as well as treatment of malnutrition, which in some cases may include targeted supplementation of macro- and/or micronutrients, when diet alone is not sufficient to meet age-specific requirements."}

However, mRNA instability, inability to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and lack of tumour targeting, hindering the further application of mRNA in brain disease therapy. Here we designed a new mRNA nanomedicine (ABNPs@mRNA) and demonstrated that it could effectively address the above challenges by combining three distinct design strategies: ApoE peptide based two birds, one stone tar-geting, cell membrane based biomimetic cloaking and tumour microenvironment responsive controlled drug release. To effectively target to glioblastoma (GBM), we loaded ABNPs@mRNA with phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) mRNA, a tumour suppressor that is mutated or inactive in 20-40% of GBM. Loss of PTEN activity in GBM patients correlates with therapeutic resistance, oncogenesis and poor prognosis. Together, our three design elements enabled ABNPs@mRNA to deliver a maximum PTEN mRNA concentration of 7.22% injection dose (ID)/g in brain tumour tissue. In the orthotopic GBM mouse models (U87MG and patient-derived CSC2 GSCs xenograft), treatment with ABNPs@mRNA resulted in a remarkable extension of median survival time relative to mice receiving PBS (49 d versus 23 d in U87MG and 40 d versus 23 d in CSC2 model). Importantly, ABNPs@mRNA nanomedicine caused negligible side effects in major organs including liver and kidney. Considering the stability, safety, non-invasive brain delivery and GBM inhibition efficacy, our new mRNA nanomedicine may unlock a new avenue for mRNA application in GBM inhibition and beyond.

The COVID-19 pandemic has crippled health systems, exacerbated household food insecurity, and reversed economic growth, which together could set back improvements in undernutrition across low-income and middle-income countries. This paper highlights how the evidence base for nutrition, health, food systems, social protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions has evolved since the 2013 Lancet Series on maternal and child nutrition and identifies the priority actions needed to regain and accelerate progress within the next decade. Policies and interventions targeting the first 1000 days of life, including some newly identified since 2013, require renewed commitment, implementation research, and increased funding from both domestic and global actors. A new body of evidence from national and state-level success stories in stunting reduction reinforces the crucial importance of multisectoral actions to address the underlying determinants of undernutrition and identifies key features of enabling political environments. To support these actions, well-resourced nutrition data and information systems are essential. The paper concludes with a call to action for the 2021 Nutrition for Growth Summit to unite global and national nutrition stakeholders around common priorities to tackle a large, unfinished undernutrition agenda-now amplified by the COVID-19 crisis."}

To fulfill the increasing requirements of sensing performance and broadening the application scope, novel materials and device design strategies have been continuously developed over the past decade. Herein, the recent progresses of flexible strain sensors developed for monitoring the physiological signals are selectively reviewed, from the perspective of the possible correlation between the device microstructure and their corresponding applications. Firstly, representative strain sensors developed based on four fundamental working mechanisms: piezoresistance, capacitance, piezoelectricity and triboelectricity are respectively introduced, subclassified by the type of active material or the similarity in microstructure. Next, a number of biomedical applications of flexible strain sensors are highlighted, including the detections of different types of physiological signals using specific microstructured strain sensors. Lastly, the role of the transduction mechanism and the device microstructure in the sensing characteristic are comprehensively discussed, and prospective forms of flexible strain sensors to meet the existing and future challenges in wearable/implantable electronics are summarized."}

Eligible studies contained (1) details of age, sex, ethnicity or co morbidities, and (2) an outcome which included admission to critical care, mechanical invasive ventilation, cardiovascular support, or death. Studies reporting outcomes in more restricted groupings of co-morbidities were eligible for narrative review. We used random effects meta-analyses for aggregate study-level data and multilevel mixed effect models for IPD data to examine risk factors (age, sex, comorbidities) associated with admission to critical care and death. Data shown are odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI).PROSPERO: CRD42021235338Findings 83 studies were included, 57 (21,549 patients) in the meta-analysis (of which 22 provided IPD) and 26 in the narrative synthesis. Most studies had an element of bias in their design or reporting. Sex was not associated with critical care or death. Compared with CYP aged 1-4 years (reference group), infants (aged < 1 year) had increased odds of admission to critical care (OR 1.63 (95% CI 1.40-1.90)) and death (OR 2.08 (1.57-2.86)). Odds of death were increased amongst CYP over 10 years (10-14 years OR 2.15 (1.54-2.98); > 14 years OR 2.15 (1.61-2.88)).The number of comorbid conditions was associated with increased odds of admission to critical care and death for COVID-19 in a step-wise fashion. Compared with CYP without comorbidity, odds ratios for critical care admission were: 1.49 (1.45-1.53) for 1 comorbidity; 2.58 (2.41-2.75) for 2 comorbidities; 2.97 (2.04-4.32) for >= 3 comorbidities. Corresponding odds ratios for death were: 2.15 (1.98-2.34) for 1 comorbidity; 4.63 (4.54-4.74) for 2 comorbidities and 4.98 (3.78-6.65) for >= 3 comorbidities. Odds of admission to critical care were increased for all co-morbidities apart from asthma (0.92 (0.91-0.94)) and malignancy (0.85 (0.17-4.21)) with an increased odds of death in all co-morbidities considered apart from asthma. Neurological and cardiac comorbidities were associated with the greatest increase in odds of severe disease or death. Obesity increased the odds of severe disease and death independently of other comorbidities. IPD analysis demonstrated that, compared to children without co-morbidity, the risk difference of admission to critical care was increased in those with 1 comorbidity by 3.61% (1.87-5.36); 2 comorbidities by9.26% (4.87-13.65);>= 3 comorbidities 10.83% (4.39-17.28), and for death: 1 comorbidity 1.50% (0.00-3.10); 2comorbidities 4.40% (-0.10-8.80) and >= 3 co-morbidities 4.70 (0.50-8.90).Interpretation Hospitalised CYP at greatest vulnerability of severe disease or death with SARS-CoV-2 infection are infants, teenagers, those with cardiac or neurological conditions, or 2 or more comorbid conditions, and those who are obese. These groups should be considered higher priority for vaccination and for protective shielding when appropriate. Whilst odds ratios were high, the absolute increase in risk for most comorbidities was small comparedto children without underlying conditions Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

Understanding the dynamics of maternal antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy and subsequent transplacental antibody transfer can inform neonatal management as well as maternal vaccination strategies. Objective To assess the association between maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody concentrations. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study took place at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1714 women delivered at the study site between April 9 and August 8, 2020. Maternal and cord blood sera were available for antibody measurement for 1471 mother/newborn dyads. Exposures SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody concentrations and transplacental transfer ratios were analyzed in combination with demographic and clinical data. Results The study cohort consisted of 1714 parturient women, with median (interquartile range) age of 32 (28-35) years, of whom 450 (26.3%) identified as Black/non-Hispanic, 879 (51.3%) as White/non-Hispanic, 203 (11.8%) as Hispanic, 126 (7.3%) as Asian, and 56 (3.3%) as other race/ethnicity. Among 1471 mother/newborn dyads for which matched sera were available, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM antibodies were detected in 83 of 1471 women (6%; 95% CI, 5%-7%) at the time of delivery, and IgG was detected in cord blood from 72 of 83 newborns (87%; 95% CI, 78%-93%). IgM was not detected in any cord blood specimen, and antibodies were not detected in any infant born to a seronegative mother. Eleven infants born to seropositive mothers were seronegative: 5 of 11 (45%) were born to mothers with IgM antibody only, and 6 of 11 (55%) were born to mothers with significantly lower IgG concentrations compared with those found among mothers of seropositive infants. Cord blood IgG concentrations were positively correlated with maternal IgG concentrations (r = 0.886; P < .001). Placental transfer ratios more than 1.0 were observed among women with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as those with mild, moderate, and severe coronavirus disease 2019. Transfer ratios increased with increasing time between onset of maternal infection and delivery. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, maternal IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were transferred across the placenta after asymptomatic as well as symptomatic infection during pregnancy. Cord blood antibody concentrations correlated with maternal antibody concentrations and with duration between onset of infection and delivery. Our findings demonstrate the potential for maternally derived SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies to provide neonatal protection from coronavirus disease 2019.Question What is the association between maternal and neonatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody concentrations? Findings In this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were transferred across the placenta in 72 of 83 pregnant women who were seropositive, and cord blood IgG concentrations were directly associated with maternal antibody concentrations, whereas IgM antibodies were not detected in any cord blood sera. Transfer ratios were associated with time elapsed from maternal infection to delivery and not associated with severity of maternal infection. Meaning Efficient transplacental transfer of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies supports the potential for maternally derived antibodies to provide neonatal protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.This cohort study assesses the association between maternal and neonatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody concentrations."}

Several studies showed some protections by certain individual dietary antioxidants against CRC development. Epidemiologic data on the composite dietary antioxidant index (CDAI) in relation to CRC risk are sparse. Using the Singapore Chinese Health Study, an ongoing prospective cohort consisting of 61 321 cancer-free participants aged 45 to 74 years at baseline, a food-based CDAI was calculated according to a previously established and validated method that included six food-sourced antioxidants including vitamins A, C and E, manganese, selenium and zinc. Cox proportional hazard regression method was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CRC associated with various levels of CDAI with adjustment for multiple potential confounders. After an average of 17.5 years of follow-up, 2140 participants developed CRC. HRs (95% CIs) of CRC for quartiles 2, 3 and 4 of CDAI were 0.94 (0.83-1.07), 0.86 (0.75-1.00) and 0.80 (0.66-0.98), respectively, compared to the lowest quartile (P-trend = .02). This inverse association between CDAI and CRC risk was more apparent in women or those without a history of diabetes, without family history of CRC, never smokers or overweight/obese individuals. However, none of the heterogeneity tests for the CDAI-CRC risk association reached statistical significance. Our findings suggest that food-based antioxidants may be beneficial for reducing the risk of CRC in the general population."}

But the time -varying resistors are expressed by mixed exponential equations, which are unavailable to directly implement in analog circuit and hinders hardware application of the Hodgkin -Huxley circuit. To hit this issue, a simplified memristive Hodgkin -Huxley (m-HH) circuit is proposed, which only involves two locally active memristors (LAMs) to depict the sodium and potassium ion channels, a capacitor to describe the neuron membrane, a DC current to represent external stimulus, and two DC voltages to express the reversal potentials. MATLAB-based numerical simulations and analog circuitbased hardware measurements display that the simplified m-HH circuit can generate memristor parameter- and DC current -related periodic spiking behaviors with different periodicities and chaotic spiking behavior. This delights that electrophysiological characteristics of ion channels and external stimulus can be employed for regulating these periodic and chaotic spiking behaviors. It is interesting that the simplified m-HH circuit can generate frequency self -adaptation and coexisting firing patterns. The inter -spike interval bifurcation diagram shows that the frequency of the periodic spiking behavior increases with the increase of externally applied DC current. Besides, the hybrid parameter bifurcation diagram displays that the simplified m-HH circuit can generate memristor initial state -related coexisting firing patterns of period -6 with chaos, period -3 with chaos, and period -3 with period -8. These offer us the unique insight into explaining some biological firing patterns. The most significance is that the analog hardware circuit is feasible in reproducing these periodic and chaotic spiking behaviors and benefits for developing spiking -based neuromorphic hardware."}

Autophagy, an intracellular lysosomal degradative pathway, can rewire cellular metabolism linking catabolic to anabolic processes and thus sustain homeostasis. This is especially relevant in the liver, a key metabolic organ that governs body energy metabolism. Autophagy's role in hepatic energy regulation has just begun to emerge and autophagy seems to have a much broader impact than what has been appreciated in the field. Though classically known for selective or bulk degradation of cellular components or energy-dense macromolecules, emerging evidence indicates autophagy selectively regulates various signaling proteins to directly impact the expression levels of metabolic enzymes or their upstream regulators. Hence, we review three specific mechanisms by which autophagy can regulate metabolism: A) nutrient regeneration, B) quality control of organelles, and C) signaling protein regulation. The plasticity of the autophagic function is unraveling a new therapeutic approach. Thus, we will also discuss the potential translation of promising preclinical data on autophagy modulation into therapeutic strategies that can be used in the clinic to treat common metabolic disorders.

{"id": "WOS_121", "text": "Nonlinear control of transcription through enhancer-promoter interactions Chromosome structure in mammals is thought to regulate transcription by modulating three-dimensional interactions between enhancers and promoters, notably through CTCF-mediated loops and topologically associating domains (TADs)(1-4). However, how chromosome interactions are actually translated into transcriptional outputs remains unclear. Here, to address this question, we use an assay to position an enhancer at large numbers of densely spaced chromosomal locations relative to a fixed promoter, and measure promoter output and interactions within a genomic region with minimal regulatory and structural complexity. A quantitative analysis of hundreds of cell lines reveals that the transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship. Mathematical modelling suggests that nonlinearity might arise from transient enhancer-promoter interactions being translated into slower promoter bursting dynamics in individual cells, therefore uncoupling the temporal dynamics of interactions from those of transcription. This uncovers a potential mechanism of how distal enhancers act from large genomic distances, and of how topologically associating domain boundaries block distal enhancers. Finally, we show that enhancer strength also determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation. Our measurements establish general principles for the context-dependent role of chromosome structure in long-range transcriptional regulation."}

Wearable sensors can potentially be used to continuously monitor stress-relevant biomarkers. However, the biological stress response is spread across the nervous, endocrine and immune systems, and the capabilities of current sensors are not sufficient for condition-specific stress response evaluation. Here we report an electronic skin for stress response assessment that non-invasively monitors three vital signs (pulse waveform, galvanic skin response and skin temperature) and six molecular biomarkers in human sweat (glucose, lactate, uric acid, sodium ions, potassium ions and ammonium). We develop a general approach to prepare electrochemical sensors that relies on analogous composite materials for stabilizing and conserving sensor interfaces. The resulting sensors offer long-term sweat biomarker analysis of more than 100 h with high stability. We show that the electronic skin can provide continuous multimodal physicochemical monitoring over a 24-hour period and during different daily activities.

Although cognitive remediation (CR) is effective and mentioned in treatment guidance for schizophrenia, its active ingredients and ideal candidates are still debated.OBJECTIVE To provide a comprehensive update on CR effectiveness for cognition and functioning in schizophrenia and analyze the core ingredients of efficacy and role of patient characteristics.DATA SOURCES The reference list of the last comprehensive meta-analysis in 2011 was screened against eligibility criteria. Then, electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and PsycInfo) were systematically searched for articles published from January 2011 to February 2020. Reference lists of included articles and relevant reviews were hand searched, and Google Scholar was manually inspected.STUDY SELECTION Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials comparing CR with any other control condition in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (with an unrestricted clinical status). Screening was performed by at least 2 independent reviewers.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Study data were independently extracted and pooled using random-effect models. Cohen d was used to measure outcomes. Trial methodological quality was evaluated with the Clinical Trials Assessment Measure.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were changes in global cognition and overall functioning from baseline to after treatment, subsequently investigated through metaregressions, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses based on prespecified hypotheses, to identify potential moderators of response associated with treatment modality and patient characteristics.RESULTS Of 1815 identified reports, 358 full texts were assessed and 194 reports on 130 studies were included. Based on 130 studies with 8851 participants, CR was effective on cognition (d, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.24-0.34]) and functioning (d, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.16-0.29]). An active and trained therapist (cognition: chi(2)(1), 4.14; P = .04; functioning: chi(2)(1), 4.26; P = .04), structured development of cognitive strategies (cognition: chi(2)(1), 9.34; P = .002; functioning: chi(2)(1), 8.12; P = .004), and integration with psychosocial rehabilitation (cognition: chi(2)(1), 5.66; functioning: chi(2)(1), 12.08) were crucial ingredients of efficacy. Patients with fewer years of education (global cognition: coefficient, -0.055 [95% CI, -0.103 to -0.006]; P = .03; global functioning: coefficient, -0.061 [95% CI, -0.112 to -0.011]; P = .02), lower premorbid IQ (global functioning: coefficient, -0.013 [-0.025 to -0.001]; P = .04), and higher baseline symptom severity (global cognition: coefficient, 0.006 [95% CI, 0.002 to 0.010]; P = .005) emerged as optimal candidates.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings show that CR is an evidence-based intervention that should be included consistently into clinical guidelines for the treatment of individuals with schizophrenia and implemented more widely in clinical practice."}

Crustaceans are a large group of invertebrates that encompasses some of the most important farmed species in the aquaculture industry. However, very few crustacean genomes have been published although an aquaculture genome project was proposed as early as 1997. Breakthroughs in next-generation and third-generation sequencing technologies and the development of high-complexity sequence assembly strategies have promoted the publication of an increasing number of crustacean genomes, thus paving a broad way for biological and genetic studies and applications in aquaculture. In this review, we summarize recent advances in crustacean genomic research as of June 2022, including genome sequencing and assembly, genomic characteristics, and the genetic mechanisms underlying various biological phenotypes, such as environmental adaptation, lifestyle, development, and sex determination. This review also discusses the application of crustacean genomes in aquaculture, including genetic dissection of economic traits and genome-based selective breeding via genome-wide association studies and genomic selection. High-quality genomes are important not only for understanding the genetic basis of biologically and economically important traits but also for the genetic improvement of aquaculture species. However, the utilization of crustacean genomics still lags far behind those in other animals. Therefore, additional multi-omics studies and technological development are needed to accelerate the application of genomics in aquaculture."}

Few studies have enabled prospective, longitudinal outcome data collection from the acute to chronic phases of recovery after msTBI.OBJECTIVE To prospectively assess outcomes in major areas of life function at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months after msTBI.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study, as part of the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) study, was conducted at 18 level 1 trauma centers in the US from February 2014 to August 2018 and prospectively assessed longitudinal outcomes, with follow-up to 12 months postinjury. Participants were patients with msTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale scores 3-12) extracted from a larger group of patients with mild, moderate, or severe TBI who were enrolled in TRACK-TBI. Data analysis took place from October 2019 to April 2021.EXPOSURES Moderate or severe TBI.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) were used to assess global functional status 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Scores on the GOSE were dichotomized to determine favorable (scores 4-8) vs unfavorable (scores 1-3) outcomes. Neurocognitive testing and patient reported outcomes at 12 months postinjury were analyzed.RESULTS A total of 484 eligible patients were included from the 2679 individuals in the TRACK-TBI study. Participants with severe TBI (n = 362; 283 men [78.2%]; median [interquartile range] age, 35.5 [25-53] years) and moderate TBI (n = 122; 98 men [80.3%); median [interquartile range] age, 38 [25-53] years) were comparable on demographic and premorbid variables. At 2 weeks postinjury, 36 of 290 participants with severe TBI (12.4%) and 38 of 93 participants with moderate TBI (41%) had favorable outcomes (GOSE scores 4-8); 301of 322 in the severe TBI group (93.5%) and 81of 103 in the moderate TBI group (78.6%) had moderate disability or worse on the DRS (total score >= 4). By 12 months postinjury, 142 of 271with severe TBI (52.4%) and 54 of 72 with moderate TBI (75%) achieved favorable outcomes. Nearly 1 in 5 participants with severe TBI (52 of 270 [19.3%]) and 1 in 3 with moderate TBI (23 of 71 [32%]) reported no disability (DRS score 0) at 12 months. Among participants in a vegetative state at 2 weeks, 62 of 79 (78%) regained consciousness and 14 of 56 with available data (25%) regained orientation by 12 months.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, patients with msTBI frequently demonstrated major functional gains, including recovery of independence, between 2 weeks and 12 months postinjury. Severe impairment in the short term did not portend poor outcomes in a substantial minority of patients with msTBI. When discussing prognosis during the first 2 weeks after injury, clinicians should be particularly cautious about making early, definitive prognostic statements suggesting poor outcomes and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in patients with msTBI."}

Here, inspired bythe auditory system(3), we introduce a fabric that operates as a sensitive audible microphone while retaining the traditional qualities of fabrics, such as machine washability and draping. The fabric medium is composed of high-Young's modulus textile yarns in the weft of a cotton warp, convertingtenuous 10(-7)-atmosphere pressure waves at audible frequencies into lower-order mechanical vibration modes. Woven into the fabric is a thermally drawn composite piezoelectric fibre that conforms to the fabric and converts the mechanical vibrations into electrical signals. Keyto the fibre sensitivity is an elastomeric cladding that concentrates the mechanical stress in a piezocomposite layer with a high piezoelectric charge coefficient of approximately 46 picocoulombs per newton, a result of the thermal drawing process. Concurrent measurements of electric output and spatial vibration patterns in response to audible acoustic excitation reveal that fabric vibrational modes with nanometre amplitude displacement are the source of the electrical output of the fibre. With the fibre subsuming lessthan 0.1% of the fabric byvolume, a single fibre draw enables tens of square metres of fabric microphone. Three different applications exemplify the usefulness of this study: a woven shirt with dual acoustic fibres measuresthe precise direction of an acoustic impulse, bidirectional communications are established between two fabrics working as sound emitters and receivers, and a shirt auscultates cardiac sound signals."}

Various bioinspired strategies have been implemented to engineer desired surface wettability for varying hydrated conditions. Although the bodily fluids can negatively affect the device performance, they also provide a rich reservoir of health-relevant information and sustained energy for next-generation stretchable self-powered devices. As a result, the design and manipulation of the surface wettability are critical to effectively control the liquid behavior on the device surface for enhanced performance. The sensors and devices with engineered surface wettability can collect and analyze health biomarkers while being minimally affected by bodily fluids or ambient humid environments.

GFAP is a protein found in glial cells and UCH-L1 is found in neurons, and these biomarkers have been cleared to aid in decision making regarding whether brain CT should be performed after traumatic brain injury. We aimed to quantify their prognostic accuracy and investigate whether these biomarkers contribute novel prognostic information to existing clinical models.Methods We enrolled patients from the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) observational cohort study. TRACK-TBI includes patients 17 years and older who are evaluated for TBI at 18 US level 1 trauma centres. All patients receive head CT at evaluation, have adequate visual acuity and hearing preinjury, and are fluent in either English or Spanish. In our analysis, we included participants aged 17-90 years who had day-of-injury plasma samples for measurement of GFAP and UCH-L1 and completed 6-month assessments for outcome due to traumatic brain injury with the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE-TBI). Biomarkers were analysed as continuous variables and in quintiles. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02119182.Findings We enrolled 2552 patients from Feb 26, 2014, to Aug 8, 2018. Of the 1696 participants with brain injury and data available at baseline and at 6 months who were included in the analysis, 120 (7 center dot 1%) died (GOSE-TBI=1), 235 (13 center dot 9%) had an unfavourable outcome (ie, GOSE-TBI =4), 1135 (66 center dot 9%) had incomplete recovery (ie, GOSE-TBI <8), and 561 (33 center dot 1%) recovered fully (ie, GOSE-TBI=8). The area under the curve (AUC) of GFAP for predicting death at 6 months in all patients was 0 center dot 87 (95% CI 0 center dot 83-0 center dot 91), for unfavourable outcome was 0 center dot 86 (0 center dot 83-0 center dot 89), and for incomplete recovery was 0 center dot 62 (0 center dot 59-0 center dot 64). The corresponding AUCs for UCH-L1 were 0 center dot 89 (95% CI 0 center dot 86-0 center dot 92) for predicting death, 0 center dot 86 (0 center dot 84-0 center dot 89) for unfavourable outcome, and 0 center dot 61 (0 center dot 59-0 center dot 64) for incomplete recovery at 6 months. AUCs were higher for participants with traumatic brain injury and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3-12 than for those with GCS score of 13-15. Among participants with GCS score of 3-12 (n=353), adding GFAP and UCH-L1 (alone or combined) to each of the three International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in traumatic brain injury models significantly increased their AUCs for predicting death (AUC range 0 center dot 90-0 center dot 94) and unfavourable outcome (AUC range 0 center dot 83-0 center dot 89). However, among participants with GCS score of 13-15 (n=1297), adding GFAP and UCH-L1 to the UPFRONT study model modestly increased the AUC for predicting incomplete recovery (AUC range 0 center dot 69-0 center dot 69, p=0 center dot 025).Interpretation In addition to their known diagnostic value, day-of-injury GFAP and UCH-L1 plasma concentrations have good to excellent prognostic value for predicting death and unfavourable outcome, but not for predicting incomplete recovery at 6 months. These biomarkers contribute the most prognostic information for participants presenting with a GCS score of 3-12."}

However, it is unknown if the increased risk of lung cancer observed in those assigned beta carotene persists beyond the conclusion of the AREDS2 trial and if there is a benefit of adding lutein/zeaxanthin to the original AREDS supplement that can be observed with long-term follow-up.OBJECTIVE To assess 10-year risk of developing lung cancer and late age-related macular degeneration (AMD).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a multicenter epidemiologic follow-up study of the AREDS2 clinical trial, conducted from December 1, 2012, to December 31, 2018. Included in the analysis were participants with bilateral or unilateral intermediate AMD for an additional 5 years after clinical trial. Eyes/participants were censored at the time of late AMD development, death, or loss to follow-up. Data were analyzed from November 2019 to March 2022.INTERVENTIONS During the clinical trial, participants were randomly assigned primarily to lutein/zeaxanthin and/or omega-3 fatty acids or placebo and secondarily to no beta carotene vs beta carotene and low vs high doses of zinc. In the epidemiologic follow-up study, all participants received AREDS2 supplements with lutein/zeaxanthin, vitamins C and E, and zinc plus copper. Outcomes were assessed at 6-month telephone calls. Analyses of AMD progression and lung cancer development were conducted using proportional hazards regression and logistic regression, respectively.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported lung cancer and late AMD validated with medical records.RESULTS This study included 3882 participants (mean [SD] baseline age, 72.0 [7.7] years; 2240 women [57.7%]) and 6351 eyes. At 10 years, the odds ratio (OR) of having lung cancer was 1.82 (95% CI, 1.06-3.12; P = .02) for those randomly assigned to beta carotene and 1.15 (95% CI, 0.79-1.66; P = .46) for lutein/zeaxanthin. The hazard ratio (HR) for progression to late AMD comparing lutein/zeaxanthin with no lutein/zeaxanthin was 0.91(95% CI, 0.84-0.99; P = .02) and comparing omega-3 fatty acids with no omega-3 fatty acids was 1.01(95% CI, 0.93-1.09; P = .91). When the lutein/zeaxanthin main effects analysis was restricted to those randomly assigned to beta carotene, the HR was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68-0.92; P = .002). A direct analysis of lutein/zeaxanthin vs beta carotene showed the HR for late AMD was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.98; P = .02). The HR for low vs high zinc was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.94-1.14; P = .49), and the HR for no beta carotene vs beta carotene was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.94-1.15; P = .48).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this long-term epidemiologic follow-up study of the AREDS2 cohort suggest that lutein/zeaxanthin was an appropriate replacement for beta carotene in AREDS2 supplements. Beta carotene usage nearly doubled the risk of lung cancer, whereas there was no statistically significant increased risk with lutein/zeaxanthin. When compared with beta carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin had a potential beneficial association with late AMD progression."}

We grouped studies based on similarity and retrieved evidence on challenges and opportunities. We used the AMSTAR 2 approach to assess the reviews' methodological quality. To evaluate the quality of the evidence, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines.Findings Our search identified 31 systematic reviews, of which 17 were published. The proportion of health-related misinformation on social media ranged from 0.2% to 28.8%. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram are critical in disseminating the rapid and far-reaching information. The most negative consequences of health misinformation are the increase of misleading or incorrect interpretations of available evidence, impact on mental health, misallocation of health resources and an increase in vaccination hesitancy. The increase of unreliable health information delays care provision and increases the occurrence of hateful and divisive rhetoric. Social media could also be a useful tool to combat misinformation during crises. Included reviews highlight the poor quality of published studies during health crises.Conclusion Available evidence suggests that infodemics during health emergencies have an adverse effect on society. Multisectoral actions to counteract infodemics and health misinformation are needed, including developing legal policies, creating and promoting awareness campaigns, improving health-related content in mass media and increasing people's digital and health literacy."}

BACKGROUND: Demographic changes and improvement in therapy have shifted the focus of treatment towards chronic diseases and multiple health conditions. This has caused a tremendous increase in data per patient that needs to be integrated longitudinally and across departmental silos. The general increase in the volume of data per diagnostic examination and the number of diagnostic procedures per diagnostic pathway additionally accentuate this data integration challenge. SUMMARY: Subspecialization in medicine has led to largely autonomously organized departments with in-dependent IT ecosystems. This patchwork of IT infrastructure is not prepared to meet the data integration challenge. The resulting lack of integrated information makes the treatment of chronically ill patients increasingly difficult and error prone.

OBJECTIVE: We summarized a decade of new research focusing on semantic data integration (SDI) since 2009, and we aim to: (1) summarize the state-of-art approaches on integrating health data and information; and (2) identify the main gaps and challenges of integrating health data and information from multiple levels and domains. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used PubMed as our focus is applications of SDI in biomedical domains and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to search and report for relevant studies published between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2021. We used Covidence-a systematic review management system-to carry out this scoping review. RESULTS: The initial search from PubMed resulted in 5,326 articles using the two sets of keywords. We then removed 44 duplicates and 5,282 articles were retained for abstract screening. After abstract screening, we included 246 articles for full-text screening, among which 87 articles were deemed eligible for full-text extraction. We summarized the 87 articles from four aspects: (1) methods for the global schema; (2) data integration strategies (i.e., federated system vs. data warehousing); (3) the sources of the data; and (4) downstream applications. CONCLUSION: SDI approach can effectively resolve the semantic heterogeneities across different data sources. We identified two key gaps and challenges in existing SDI studies that (1) many of the existing SDI studies used data from only single-level data sources (e.g., integrating individual-level patient records from different hospital systems), and (2) documentation of the data integration processes is sparse, threatening the reproducibility of SDI studies."}

AIM: To define clinical common data elements (CDEs) and a mandatory minimum data set (MDS) for genomic studies of cerebral palsy (CP). METHOD: Candidate data elements were collated following a review of the literature and existing CDEs. An online, three-round Delphi survey was used to rate each data element as either 'core', 'recommended', 'exploratory', or 'not required'. Members of the International Cerebral Palsy Genomics Consortium (ICPGC) rated the core CDEs as either mandatory or not, to form the MDS. For both the CDEs and the MDS, a data element was considered to have reached consensus if more than 75% of respondents agreed.

Common data elements contribute to the National Institutes of Health-supported principle of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusableness of research data. Routine use of Common data elements and standardized definitions within pediatric critical care research are likely to promote collaboration, improve quality, and consistency of data collection, improve overall efficiency of study or trial setup, and facilitate cross-study comparisons, meta-analysis, and merging of study cohorts. The purpose of this Pediatric Critical Care Medicine Perspective is to establish a road map for the development of multinational, multidisciplinary consensus-based common data elements that could be adapted for use within any pediatric critical care subject area. METHODS: We describe a multistep process for the creation of \"core domains\" of research (e.g. patient outcomes, health-related conditions, or aspects of health) and the development of common data elements within each core domain. We define a tiered approach to data collection based on relevance of each common data element to future studies and clinical practice within the field of interest.

PURPOSE: To better use genetic testing, which is used by clinicians to explain the molecular mechanism of disease and to suggest clinical actionability and new treatment options, clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) laboratories must send the results into reports in PDF and discrete data element format (HL7). Although most clinical diagnostic tests have set molecular markers tested and have a set range of values or a binary result (positive or negative), the NGS genetic test could examine hundreds or thousands of genes with no predefined list of variants. Although there are some commercial and open-source tools for clinically reporting genomics results for oncology testing, they often lack necessary features. METHODS: Using several available software tools for data storage including MySQL and MongoDB, database querying with Python, and a web-based user application using JAVA and JAVA script, we have developed a tool to store and query complex genomics and demographics data, which can be manually curated and reported by the user. RESULTS: We have developed a tool, Annotation SoftWare for Electronic Reporting (ANSWER), that can allow molecular pathologists to (1) filter variants to find those meeting quality control metrics in the genes that are clinically actionable by diagnosis; (2) visualize variants using data generated in the bioinformatics analysis; (3) create annotations that can be reused in future reports with association specific to the gene, variant, or diagnosis; (4) select variants and annotations that should be reported to match the details of the case; and (5) generate a report that includes demographics, reported variants, clinical actionability annotation, and references that can be exported into PDF or HL7 format, which can be electronically sent to an electronic health record. CONCLUSION: ANSWER is a tool that can be installed locally and is designed to meet the clinical reporting needs of a clinical oncology NGS laboratory for reporting."}

However, because of variation in testing density and policies, the metric is not standardized across facilities. Two types of burdens exist, one related to the infection control measures that patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 require and one from the care of severely ill patients receiving treatment of COVID-19. With rising population immunity from vaccination and infection, as well as the availability of therapeutics, severity of illness has declined. Prior research showed that dexamethasone administration was highly correlated with other disease severity metrics and sensitive to the changing epidemiology associated with the emergence of immune-evasive variants. On 10 January 2022, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health began requiring hospitals to expand surveillance to include reports of both the total number of \"COVID-19 hospitalizations\" daily and the number of inpatients who received dexamethasone at any point during their hospital stay. All 68 acute care hospitals in Massachusetts submitted COVID-19 hospitalization and dexamethasone data daily to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health over a 1-year period. A total of 44 196 COVID-19 hospitalizations were recorded during 10 January 2022 to 9 January 2023, of which 34% were associated with dexamethasone administration. The proportion of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had received dexamethasone was 49.6% during the first month of surveillance and decreased to a monthly average of approximately 33% by April 2022, where it has remained since (range, 28.7% to 33%).

Regulatory agencies protect their communities by ensuring that new health professionals have the required qualifications to practice safely and by tracking the volume and distribution of those professionals on an ongoing basis. The speed and accuracy of sharing these data could be greatly improved through the adoption of a data standard for information about health professionals. To date, however, no internationally accepted standard has emerged for this purpose. PURPOSE: This study examines three existing XML standards designed for the representation of individual worker data to determine if, and to what degree, each could be used for the tracking of health professionals. METHODS: The data elements of the Europass schema, the HR Open Standard Recruiting specification, and the MedBiquitous Healthcare Professional Profile standard were fully examined and matching elements were mapped to the 200+ elements identified from a prior content analysis as required by a sample of 20 international regulatory agencies. RESULTS: None of the schemas examined addressed more than half of the information elements required by regulators. All three schemas are found lacking in some key areas of interest, especially vital information that could disqualify ineligible applicant practitioners.

Persons with ME/CFS have a substantial reduction in their ability to engage in pre-illness levels of activity. Multiple symptoms include profound fatigue, post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive impairment, orthostatic intolerance, pain, and other symptoms persisting for more than 6 months. Diagnosis is challenging due to fluctuating and complex symptoms. ME/CFS Common Data Elements (CDEs) were identified in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Common Data Element Repository. This study reviewed ME/CFS CDEs item content. METHODS: Inclusion criteria for CDEs (measures recommended for ME/CFS) analysis: 1) assesses symptoms; 2) developed for adults; 3) appropriate for patient reported outcome measure (PROM); 4) does not use visual or pictographic responses. Team members independently reviewed CDEs item content using the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework to link meaningful concepts. RESULTS: 119 ME/CFS CDEs (measures) were reviewed and 38 met inclusion criteria, yielding 944 items linked to 1503 ICF meaningful concepts. Most concepts linked to ICF Body Functions component (b-codes; n = 1107, 73.65%) as follows: Fatiguability (n = 220, 14.64%), Energy Level (n = 166, 11.04%), Sleep Functions (n = 137, 9.12%), Emotional Functions (n = 131, 8.72%) and Pain (n = 120, 7.98%). Activities and Participation concepts (d codes) accounted for a smaller percentage of codes (n = 385, 25.62%). Most d codes were linked to the Mobility category (n = 69, 4.59%) and few items linked to Environmental Factors (e codes; n = 11, 0.73%).

To improve global health and help address this burden, there has been a rise in surgical outreach to LMICs. In high-income countries, an electronic health record (EHR) is used to document and communicate data critical to the quality of care and patient safety. Despite this, there is little guidance or precedence on the data elements or processes for utilizing an EHR on outreach trips. We validated data elements and process steps for utilizing an EHR for hand surgery outreach trips. Methods We conducted a literature review to identify data elements collected during surgical outreach trips. A future-state process map for the collection and documentation of data elements within an EHR was developed through literature review and semistructured interviews with experts in global outreach. An expert consortium completed a modified RAND/University of California at Los Angeles Delphi process to evaluate the importance and feasibility of each data element and process step. Results In total, 65 data elements (e.g., date of birth) and 24 process steps (e.g., surgical site marking) were validated for use in an EHR for hand surgery outreach trips to LMICs. Conclusion This validated portfolio of data elements/process steps can serve as the foundation for pilot testing of an EHR to document and communicate critical patient data on hand surgery outreach trips.

As such, the purpose of this systematic review was to identify and describe self-management interventions and their impact on self-management outcomes in adults with systemic sclerosis. Studies were included if they contained a self-management intervention, incorporated at least one self-management outcome identified as a common data element by the National Institute of Nursing Research (i.e., patient activation, self-efficacy, self-regulation, global health), and were conducted in adults with systemic sclerosis.

Each source data element was semantically annotated using the Unified Medical Language System. The concept codes were analyzed for semantic overlaps. A concept was considered common if it appeared in at least two documentation contexts. The resulting common concepts were extended with implementation details, including data types and permissible values based on frequent patterns of source data elements, using an established expert-based and semiautomatic approach. RESULTS: In total, 3287 data elements were identified, and 1051 of these emerged as unique medical concepts. The 100 most frequent medical concepts cover 9.51% (100/1051) of all concept occurrences in stroke documentation, and the 50 most frequent concepts cover 4.75% (50/1051). A list of common data elements was implemented in different standardized machine-readable formats on a public metadata repository for interoperable reuse. CONCLUSIONS: Standardization of medical documentation is a prerequisite for data exchange as well as the transferability and reuse of data. In the long run, standardization would save time and money and extend the capabilities for which such data could be used. In the context of this work, a lack of standardization was observed regarding current information management. Free-form text fields and intricate questions complicate automated data access and transfer between institutions. This work also revealed the potential of a unified documentation process as a core data set of the 50 most frequent common data elements, accounting for 34% of the documentation in medical information management. Such a data set offers a starting point for standardized and interoperable data collection in routine care, quality management, and clinical research."}
{"id": "PUB_20", "text": "Linking a Consortium-Wide Data Quality Assessment Tool with the MIRACUM Metadata BACKGROUND: Many research initiatives aim at using data from electronic health records (EHRs) in observational studies. Participating sites of the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) established data integration centers to integrate EHR data within research data repositories to support local and federated analyses. To address concerns regarding possible data quality (DQ) issues of hospital routine data compared with data specifically collected for scientific purposes, we have previously presented a data quality assessment (DQA) tool providing a standardized approach to assess DQ of the research data repositories at the MIRACUM consortium's partner sites. OBJECTIVES: Major limitations of the former approach included manual interpretation of the results and hard coding of analyses, making their expansion to new data elements and databases time-consuming and error prone. We here present an enhanced version of the DQA tool by linking it to common data element definitions stored in a metadata repository (MDR), adopting the harmonized DQA framework from Kahn et al and its application within the MIRACUM consortium. METHODS: Data quality checks were consequently aligned to a harmonized DQA terminology. Database-specific information were systematically identified and represented in an MDR. Furthermore, a structured representation of logical relations between data elements was developed to model plausibility-statements in the MDR. RESULTS: The MIRACUM DQA tool was linked to data element definitions stored in a consortium-wide MDR. Additional databases used within MIRACUM were linked to the DQ checks by extending the respective data elements in the MDR with the required information. The evaluation of DQ checks was automated. An adaptable software implementation is provided with the R package DQAstats. CONCLUSION: The enhancements of the DQA tool facilitate the future integration of new data elements and make the tool scalable to other databases and data models. It has been provided to all ten MIRACUM partners and was successfully deployed and integrated into their respective data integration center infrastructure."}

OBJECTIVES: Computable social risk factor phenotypes derived from routinely collected structured electronic health record (EHR) or health information exchange (HIE) data may represent a feasible and robust approach to measuring social factors. This study convened an expert panel to identify and assess the quality of individual EHR and HIE structured data elements that could be used as components in future computable social risk factor phenotypes. STUDY DESIGN: Technical expert panel. METHODS: A 2-round Delphi technique included 17 experts with an in-depth knowledge of available EHR and/or HIE data. The first-round identification sessions followed a nominal group approach to generate candidate data elements that may relate to socioeconomics, cultural context, social relationships, and community context. In the second-round survey, panelists rated each data element according to overall data quality and likelihood of systematic differences in quality across populations (ie, bias). RESULTS: Panelists identified a total of 89 structured data elements. About half of the data elements (n = 45) were related to socioeconomic characteristics. The panelists identified a diverse set of data elements. Elements used in reimbursement-related processes were generally rated as higher quality. Panelists noted that several data elements may be subject to implicit bias or reflect biased systems of care, which may limit their utility in measuring social factors. CONCLUSIONS: Routinely collected structured data within EHR and HIE systems may reflect patient social risk factors. Identifying and assessing available data elements serves as a foundational step toward developing future computable social factor phenotypes."}

{"id": "PUB_24", "text": "Traceable Research Data Sharing in a German Medical Data Integration Center With BACKGROUND: Secondary investigations into digital health records, including electronic patient data from German medical data integration centers (DICs), pave the way for enhanced future patient care. However, only limited information is captured regarding the integrity, traceability, and quality of the (sensitive) data elements. This lack of detail diminishes trust in the validity of the collected data. From a technical standpoint, adhering to the widely accepted FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles for data stewardship necessitates enriching data with provenance-related metadata. Provenance offers insights into the readiness for the reuse of a data element and serves as a supplier of data governance. OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study is to augment the reusability of clinical routine data within a medical DIC for secondary utilization in clinical research. Our aim is to establish provenance traces that underpin the status of data integrity, reliability, and consequently, trust in electronic health records, thereby enhancing the accountability of the medical DIC. We present the implementation of a proof-of-concept provenance library integrating international standards as an initial step. METHODS: We adhered to a customized road map for a provenance framework, and examined the data integration steps across the ETL (extract, transform, and load) phases. Following a maturity model, we derived requirements for a provenance library. Using this research approach, we formulated a provenance model with associated metadata and implemented a proof-of-concept provenance class. Furthermore, we seamlessly incorporated the internationally recognized Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C) provenance standard, aligned the resultant provenance records with the interoperable health care standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, and presented them in various representation formats. Ultimately, we conducted a thorough assessment of provenance trace measurements. RESULTS: This study marks the inaugural implementation of integrated provenance traces at the data element level within a German medical DIC. We devised and executed a practical method that synergizes the robustness of quality- and health standard-guided (meta)data management practices. Our measurements indicate commendable pipeline execution times, attaining notable levels of accuracy and reliability in processing clinical routine data, thereby ensuring accountability in the medical DIC. These findings should inspire the development of additional tools aimed at providing evidence-based and reliable electronic health record services for secondary use. CONCLUSIONS: The research method outlined for the proof-of-concept provenance class has been crafted to promote effective and reliable core data management practices. It aims to enhance biomedical data by imbuing it with meaningful provenance, thereby bolstering the benefits for both research and society. Additionally, it facilitates the streamlined reuse of biomedical data. As a result, the system mitigates risks, as data analysis without knowledge of the origin and quality of all data elements is rendered futile. While the approach was initially developed for the medical DIC use case, these principles can be universally applied throughout the scientific domain."}

We report the results of implementing common data elements (CDEs) to document epilepsy history data in the electronic medical record (EMR) after 12 months of clinical use in outpatient encounters. METHODS: Data regarding seizure frequency were collected during routine clinical encounters using a CDE-based form within our EMR. We extracted CDE data from the EMR and developed measurements for seizure severity and seizure improvement scores. Seizure burden and improvement was evaluated by patient demographic and encounter variables for in-person and telemedicine encounters. RESULTS: We assessed a total of 1696 encounters in 1038 individuals with childhood epilepsies between September 6, 2019 and September 11, 2020 contributed by 32 distinct providers. Childhood absence epilepsy (n = 121), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 86), and Dravet syndrome (n = 42) were the most common epilepsy syndromes. Overall, 43% (737/1696) of individuals had at least monthly seizures, 17% (296/1696) had a least daily seizures, and 18% (311/1696) were seizure-free for >12 months. Quantification of absolute seizure burden and changes in seizure burden over time differed between epilepsy syndromes, including high and persistent seizure burden in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Individuals seen via telemedicine or in-person encounters had comparable seizure frequencies. Individuals identifying as Hispanic/Latino, particularly from postal codes with lower median household incomes, were more likely to have ongoing seizures that worsened over time. SIGNIFICANCE: Standardized documentation of clinical data in childhood epilepsies through CDE can be implemented in routine clinical care at scale and enables assessment of disease burden, including characterization of seizure burden over time. Our data provide insights into heterogeneous patterns of seizure control in common pediatric epilepsy syndromes and will inform future initiatives focusing on patient-centered outcomes in childhood epilepsies, including the impact of telemedicine and health care disparities."}

METHODS: A multidisciplinary expert team was established for this project. Based on industry standards and practical feasibility, the team designed the nasopharyngeal carcinoma data element standards including 14 modules and 640 fields. Data from patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who visited Southern Hospital after 1999 were extracted from 15 EHRs systems and were cleaned, structured, and standardized using information technologies such as machine learning and natural language processing. In addition, a series of measures such as quality control and data encryption were taken to ensure data quality and patient privacy. At the platform application level, 10 functional modules were designed according to the needs of nasopharyngeal carcinoma research. RESULTS: As of 1 October 2022, the Big Data platform has included 11,617patients, of whom 8228 (70.83 %) were male and 3389 (29.17 %) were female, with a median age of 48 years (interquartile range, 40 years). The data in the platform were validated to have a high level of completeness and accuracy, especially for key variables such as social demographics, laboratory tests and vital signs. Currently, six projects involving risk factors, early diagnosis, treatment efficacy and prevention of treatment-related toxic reactions have been conducted on the platform. CONCLUSIONS: We have established a high-quality NPC-specific big data platform by integrating heterogeneous data from multiple sources in the EHR. The platform provides an effective tool and strong data support for real-world studies of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which helps to improve research efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the quality of research results. We expect to promote multicenter nasopharyngeal carcinoma data sharing in the future to facilitate the generation of high-quality real-world evidence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

{"id": "PUB_28", "text": "Genesis of improved quality in imaging through a national Australian BACKGROUND: Despite rapid technological advances and growth, quality in imaging has not received the focus seen elsewhere in cardiovascular medicine, resulting in significant gaps between guidelines and practice. Contemporary echocardiography practice requires comprehensive real-time data collection to allow dynamic auditing and benchmarking of key performance indices. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) proposed additional data standardisation, structured reporting identifying key data elements and imaging registries. In the absence of an Australian echocardiography registry, we developed a national clinical quality registry (GenesisCare Cardiovascular Outcomes Echo Registry). We hypothesised that measurement and local reporting of data would improve compliance of echo studies with quality guidelines and hence their clinical value. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively collected data on 4 099 281 echocardiographic studies entered directly into a central electronic database from 63 laboratories across four Australian states between 2010 and 2021. Real-time auditing of key data elements and introduction of quality improvement pathways were performed to maximise completeness and uniformity of data acquisition and reporting. We compared completeness of key data element acquisition (AV peak velocity, left ventricular ejection fraction, E/e', LA area, rhythm, RVSP) by time and state using de-identified data. Key performance outcomes benchmarked against the aggregated study cohort and international standards were reported to individual sites to drive quality improvement. Between 2010 and 2014 there were significant improvements in data completeness (72.0%+/-26.8% vs 86.8%+/-13.5%, p=0.02), which were maintained to 2020. In addition, interstate variability fell for both EF and E/e' (p<0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale collaboration provides a platform for the development of major quality improvement initiatives in echocardiography. Introduction of local quality assurance programmes via a unified national data set significantly improved the completeness of reporting of key echo quality measures. This in turn significantly improved the quality of, and reduced the interstate variability of, echo data. Developing a centralised database allowed rapid adoption nationally of local quality improvements."}

Identifying and introducing a Data Set (DS) can help solve this challenge. The aim of this study was to identify and present a DS for the design and implementation of the upper limb disability registry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, to identify the administrative and clinical data elements required for registry, a comprehensive study was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Then, the necessary data elements were extracted from the studies and a questionnaire was designed based on them. In the second phase, in order to confirm the DS, the questionnaire was distributed to 20 orthopedic, physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians and physiotherapists during a two-round Delphi. In order to analyze the data, the frequency and mean score of each data element were calculated. Data elements that received an agreement more than 75% in the first or two-round Delphi were considered for the final DS. RESULTS: A total of 81 data elements in five categories of \"demographic data\", \"clinical presentation\", \"past medical history\", \"psychological issues\", and \"pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments\" were extracted from the studies. Finally, 78 data elements were approved by experts as essential data elements for designing a patient registry for upper limb disabilities. CONCLUSION: In this study, the data elements necessary for the design and implementation of the upper limb disability registry were suggested. This DS can help registry designers and health data administrators know what data needs to be included in the registry system in order to have a successful design and implementation. Moreover, this standardized DS can be effective for integrating and improving the information management of people with upper limb disabilities and used to accurately gather the upper limb disabilities data for research and policymaking purposes."}

OBJECTIVE: The introduction of blockchain and smart contract technologies to the legacy Health Avatar Platform with a clinical metadata registry remarkably strengthens decentralized health data integrity and immutable transaction traceability at the corresponding data-element level in a privacy-preserving fashion. A crypto-economy ecosystem was built to facilitate secure and traceable exchanges of sensitive health data. METHODS: The Health Avatar Platform decentralizes patient data in appropriate locations (ie, on patients' smartphones and on physicians' smart devices). We implemented an Ethereum-based hash chain for all transactions and smart contract-based processes to guarantee decentralized data integrity and to generate block data containing transaction metadata on-chain. Parameters of all types of data communications were enumerated and incorporated into 3 smart contracts, in this case, a health data transaction manager, a transaction status manager, and an application programming interface transaction manager. The actual decentralized health data are managed in an off-chain manner on appropriate smart devices and authenticated by hashed metadata on-chain. RESULTS: Metadata of each data transaction are captured in a Health Avatar Platform blockchain node by the smart contracts. We provide workflow diagrams each of the 3 use cases of data push (from a physician app or an intelligent agents to a patient Avatar), data pull (request to a patient Avatar by other entities), and data backup transactions. Each transaction can be finely managed at the corresponding data-element level rather than at the resource or document levels. Hash-chained metadata support data element-level verification of data integrity in subsequent transactions. Smart contracts can incentivize transactions for data sharing and intelligent digital health care services. CONCLUSIONS: Health Avatar Platform and interconnected patient Avatars, physician apps, and intelligent agents provide a decentralized blockchain ecosystem for health data that enables trusted and finely tuned data sharing and facilitates health value-creating transactions with smart contracts."}

We identified existing CDEs and evaluated their validity and usability, which is required prior to infrastructure implementation within EHRs. METHODS: We conducted (a) a systematic literature review of publications in Medline, Embase and the Web of Science using a combination of at least one term related to OUD and EHR and (b) an environmental scan of publicly available data systems and dictionaries used in national informatics and quality measurement of policy initiatives. Opioid-related data elements identified within the environmental scan were compared with related data elements contained within nine common health data code systems and each element was graded for alignment with match results categorized as \"exact\", \"partial\", or \"none.\" RESULTS: The literature review identified 5186 articles for title search, of which 75 abstracts were included for review and 38 articles were selected for full-text review. Full-text articles yielded 237 CDEs, only 12 (5.06%) of which were opioid-specific. The environmental scan identified 379 potential data elements and value sets across 9 data systems and libraries, among which only 84 (22%) were opioid-specific. We found substantial variability in the types of clinical data elements with limited overlap and no single data system included CDEs across all major data element types such as substance use disorder, OUD, medication and mental health. Relative to common health data code systems, few data elements had an exact match (< 1%), while 61% had a partial match and 38% had no matches. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increasing ubiquity of EHR data standards and national attention placed on the opioid epidemic, we found substantial fragmentation in the design and construction of OUD related CDEs and little OUD specific CDEs in existing data dictionaries, systems and literature. Given the significant gaps in data collection and reporting, future work should leverage existing structured data elements to create standard workflow processes to improve OUD data capture in EHR systems."}

While some indicators are generic and can be calculated without domain knowledge, others require information about a specific data element. Even more complex are indicators addressing contradictions, that stem from implausible combinations of multiple data elements. In this paper, we investigate how contradictions within interdependent categorical data can be identified and if they give additional information about possible quality issues, their cause, and mitigation options. The 19 data elements that represent four biosample types including their pre-analytic states within the DZHK Biobanking basic set are exported to the CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM), transformed and loaded into a tranSMART instance. Through the implementation of a data quality assessment workflow as a SmartR plug-in, statistical information about the domain-specific consistency of interdependent values are retrieved, assessed, and visualized. Data quality indicators have been selected for the assessment according to common recommendations found in the literature. Different contradictions could be discovered in the dataset including mismatch of interdependent values in the pre-analytic states of blood and urine samples, as well as primary and aliquoted samples. The overall assessment rating shows that 99.61% of the interdependent values are free of contradictions. However, measures within the EDC design to avoid contradictions may result in overestimated missing rates in automatic, item-based quality assessment checks. Through consistency checks on interdependent categorical features, we demonstrated that consistency flaws can be found in the categorical data of biobanking metadata and that they can help to detect issues in the data entry process. Our approach underscores the importance of domain knowledge in the definition of the consistency rules but also knowledge about the EDC implementation of such consistency rules to consider the impact on item-based quality indicators."}

{"id": "PUB_36", "text": "An international Delphi consensus process to determine a common data element and BACKGROUND: Despite increased recognition of frailty and its importance, high quality evidence to guide decision-making is lacking. There has been variation in reported data elements and outcomes which makes it challenging to interpret results across studies as well as to generalize research findings. The creation of a frailty core set, consisting of a minimum set of data elements and outcomes to be measured in all frailty studies, would allow for findings from research and translational studies to be collectively analyzed to better inform care and decision-making. To achieve this, the Frailty Outcomes Consensus Project was developed to reach consensus from the international frailty community on a set of common data elements and core outcomes for frailty. METHODS: An international steering committee developed the methodology and the consensus process to be followed. The committee formulated the initial list of data elements and outcomes. Participants from across the world were invited to take part in the Delphi consensus process. The Delphi consisted of three rounds. Following review of data after three rounds, a final ranking round of data elements and outcomes was conducted. A required retention rate of 80% between rounds was set a priori. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-four panelists from 25 different countries participated in the first round of the Delphi consensus process. This included researchers, clinicians, administrators, older adults, and caregivers. The retention rate between rounds was achieved. Data elements and outcomes forming primary and secondary core sets were identified, within the domains of participant characteristics, physical performance, physical function, physical health, cognition and mental health, socioenvironmental circumstances, frailty measures, and other. CONCLUSION: It is anticipated that implementation and uptake of the frailty core set will enable studies to be collectively analyzed to better inform care for persons living with frailty and ultimately improve their outcomes.

There are several methods to prevent prescription errors, one of which is to use a Computerized Physician Order Entry system (CPOE). In a CPOE system, necessary data needs to be collected so that making decisions about prescribing medications and treatment plans could be made. Although many CPOE systems have been developed worldwide, studies have yet to identify the necessary data and data elements of CPOE systems. This study aims to identify data elements of CPOE and standardize these data with Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to facilitate data sharing and integration with the electronic health record (EHR) system and reduce data diversity. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus databases for studies up to October 2019 were searched. Two reviewers independently assessed original articles to determine eligibility for inclusion in this review. All articles describing data elements of a COPE system were included. Data elements were obtained from the included articles' text, tables, and figures.Classification of the extracted data elements and mapping them to FHIR was done to facilitate data sharing and integration with the electronic health record (EHR) system and reduce data diversity. The final data elements of CPOE were categorized into five main categories of FHIR (foundation, base, clinical, financial, and specialized) and 146 resources, where possible. One of the researchers did mapping and checked and verified by the second researcher. If a data element could not be mapped to any FHIR resources, this data element was considered an extension to the most relevant resource. RESULTS: We retrieved 5162 articles through database searches. After the full-text assessment, 21 articles were included. In total, 270 data elements were identified and mapped to the FHIR standard. These elements have been reported in 26 FHIR resources of 146 ones (18%). In total, 71 data elements were considered an extension. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that the same data elements were not used in the CPOE systems, and the degree of homogeneity of these systems is limited. The mapping of extracted data with data elements used in the FHIR standard shows the extent to which these systems comply with existing standards. Considering the standards in these systems' design helps developers design more coherent systems that can share data with other systems."}

In shared decision-making (SDM), patients and clinicians work collaboratively to reach evidence-based health decisions that align with individual circumstances, values, and preferences. This personalized approach to clinical care likely has substantial benefits in the oversight of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), a type of nontraumatic spinal cord injury. Its chronicity, heterogeneous clinical presentation, complex management, and variable disease course engenders an imperative for a patient-centric approach that accounts for each patient's unique needs and priorities.

We first addressed the lack of statistical methods for deriving phenotypes from EHR data when data elements are inconsistently available across patients and this missingness in data elements may be related to the underlying health status of the patient. We then developed statistical methods to reduce bias in analyses of observational data using EHR-derived phenotypes. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this research were to develop, evaluate and apply statistical methods for estimating EHR-derived phenotypes, the collection of characteristics describing a patient, in the presence of inconsistently collected data elements and statistical methods for valid estimation of outcome/exposure associations using such EHR-derived phenotypes. METHODS: We developed a Bayesian latent class approach to EHR-based phenotyping which incorporates the availability of data elements as an additional predictor of the latent phenotype to address dependence of data element availability on the underlying true phenotype. In a series of simulation studies, performance of this latent phenotype was compared to standard computable phenotypes with and without using multiple imputation to address missing data. Probabilistic phenotypes, such as the Bayesian latent phenotype, can be incorporated into subsequent outcome/exposure association studies. However, because these phenotypes are imperfect, standard association estimates will be biased. This is a limitation of any analysis using imperfect, EHR-derived phenotypes. Because phenotyping-error can be differential or non-differential, bias can be towards or away from the null. We developed closed-form bias correction formulas for odds ratios, relative risks, and risk differences estimated using probabilistic phenotypes. Simulation studies compared bias-corrected estimates to naive estimates based on dichotomizing the probabilistic phenotype, the standard approach used in EHR-based analyses. Finally, using data from six sites participating in the PCORI-funded PEDSnet consortium, we investigated the association between development of type 2 diabetes in adolescence and characteristics of the early-life body mass index (BMI) trajectory. This work used the Bayesian latent phenotyping model to characterize type 2 diabetes phenotypes and connected these phenotypes to parameters of the BMI trajectory via a Bayesian joint model. Chart review was not performed for PEDSnet data, so no “gold-standard” phenotypes were available. RESULTS: In simulation studies, the latent class approach had similar sensitivity to a standard computable phenotype (95.9% vs 91.9%) while substantially improving specificity (99.7% vs 90.8%). Multiple imputation of missing biomarker values modestly improved sensitivity relative to a standard computable phenotype (92.3% vs 91.9%) but at the cost of decreased specificity (90.8% vs 90.7%). Results were similar under missing not at random missingness patterns in which missingness in biomarkers was associated with the underlying true phenotype. When used in outcome/exposure association studies incorporating the proposed bias-correction factor, estimates of all three association parameters were approximately unbiased. In contrast, the naive approach of dichotomizing the probabilistic phenotype was strongly biased towards the null. In an analysis of the association between characteristics of the early-life BMI trajectory and type 2 diabetes in adolescence, we found that children who experienced adiposity rebound between 5 and 9 years had higher odds of subsequent type 2 diabetes than children with age at rebound between 2 and 5 years (odds ratio [OR] for age at adiposity rebound of 5-9 years 1.2, 95% credible interval 1.12-2.35). Children with a predicted BMI at age 9 years in excess of 140% of the 95th percentile for age and sex had the highest odds of adolescent type 2 diabetes (OR 6.22 relative to BMI between 100 and 120% of the 95th percentile, 95% credible interval 4.35-8.17). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed latent phenotyping approach provides a means of combining data elements with variable availability across patients, and can perform well even when missingness is associated with the underlying health status of the patient. Advanced methodologic approaches have the potential to leverage EHR data to investigate relationships among variables routinely collected in healthcare data. This may be of particular relevance to pediatric research because many phenotypes are rare in children, necessitating use of large cohorts. Judicious use of EHR data in combination with appropriate statistical methods to address their shortcomings has the potential to facilitate efficient studies of rare diseases and increase equitable representation of all children in research.

{"id": "PUB_42", "text": "Data Completeness and Concordance in the FeverApp Registry: Comparative Study. BACKGROUND: The FeverApp registry uses ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to collect parental data on pediatric fever for scientific research. The mobile app FeverApp educates parents on safe fever management and serves as a fever diary. OBJECTIVE: The focus of this study was to evaluate the completeness and concordance of the EMA-based FeverApp registry with regard to its data quality from a multilevel perspective. METHODS: Structured descriptions of fever episodes by health care professionals from an office were used as reference. The number of children, their sociodemographic data, and agreement of fever episodes, with maximum temperature, intake of antipyretics and antibiotics, and physician visits, were compared with the entries in the corresponding physician's reference records. The data quality indicators for completeness, meaning the extent to which the necessary data for the registry has actually been submitted, and concordance, which is the correspondence of the value of a data element with a reference source, were chosen to analyze whether EMA may be a suitable method for this kind of registry. RESULTS: In both data sources, 1012 children were available for comparison over 16 months. The completeness of gender (1012/1012, 100%) and date of birth (1004/1012, 99.2%) information was high, and the mismatches were 0.69% (7/1012) and 1.19% (12/1012), respectively, between the sources. Of these 1012 children, 668 (66%) registered fever episodes in FeverApp. They relate to 534 families with 953 fever episodes in the reference records and 1452 episodes in the FeverApp registry. Of the 534 families, 183 (34.3%) refrained from visiting the office during fever episodes but nevertheless documented them in FeverApp. Largest part (766/1452, 52.75%) episodes were recorded exclusively in the FeverApp registry by 371 (371/534, 69.5%) families. The remaining 686 (47.2%) episodes of 391 (58.5%) children from 351 (65.7%) families were comparable with the reference data source in terms of physician visits, medication, and temperature. The completeness ranged, depending on the kind of variable, from 11.5% to 65% in the registry and from 7.6% to 42.6% in the office. The 953 fever episodes reported by the reference office consisted of 681 (71.5%) acute and 272 (28.5%) past episodes. In FeverApp, most past (262/272, 96.3%) but less acute (424/681, 62.3%) episodes have been entered. The concordance rates were varied: 90.2% for antibiotic use, 66.6% for antipyretic use, 61.7% for physician visits, and 16% for the highest temperature during the fever episode. CONCLUSIONS: Both sources delivered only partial data, and the rates of completeness and concordance depended on the kind of variable. However, the FeverApp registry showed higher documentation and precision rates than professional records for all considered variables. Therefore, EMA may play a unique supplement for research in ambulatory care. FeverApp could support pediatric offices, especially during the pandemic."}
{"id": "PUB_43", "text": "Implementation of a Pharmacist-Led Antimicrobial Time-Out for Medical-Surgery OBJECTIVE: This report describes a quality improvement initiative to implement a pharmacist-led antimicrobial time-out (ATO) in a large, freestanding pediatric hospital. Our goal was to reach 90% ATO completion and documentation for eligible patients hospitalized on general pediatric medicine or surgery services. METHODS: A multidisciplinary quality improvement team developed an ATO process and electronic documentation tool. Clinical pharmacists were responsible to initiate and document an ATO for pediatric medicine or surgery patients on or before the fifth calendar day of therapy. The quality improvement team educated pharmacists and physicians and provided ATO audit and feedback to the pharmacists. We used statistical process control methods to track monthly rates of ATO completion retrospectively from October 2017 through March 2018 and prospectively from April 2018 through April 2019. Additionally, we retrospectively evaluated the completion of 6 data elements in the ATO note over the final 12-month period of the study. RESULTS: Among 647 eligible antimicrobial courses over the 19-month study period, the mean monthly documentation rate increased from 54.6% to 83.5% (p < 0.001). The mean ATO documentation rate increased from 32.8% to 74.2% (p < 0.001) for the pediatric medicine service and from 65.0% to 88.1% for the pediatric surgery service (p = 0.006). Among 302 notes assessed for completeness, 35.8% had all the required data fields completed. A tentative antimicrobial stop date was the data element completed least often (49.3%). CONCLUSIONS: We implemented a pharmacist-led ATO, highlighting the role pharmacists play in antimicrobial stewardship. Additional efforts are needed to further increase ATO completion rates and to define treatment duration."}

Wearable technology provides an opportunity to understand physiologic and behavioral changes across pregnancy with greater detail, more frequent measurements, and improved accuracy. The aim of this study is to describe changes in physiologic and behavioral sensor-based health metrics during pregnancy and postpartum in the Apple Women's Health Study (AWHS) and their relationship to demographic factors. METHODS: The Apple Women's Health Study is a digital, longitudinal, observational study that includes U.S. residents with an iPhone and Apple Watch. We evaluated changes from pre-pregnancy through delivery and postpartum for sensor-derived health metrics. Minimum required data samples per day, week and overall were data element specific, and included 12 weeks prior to pregnancy start, and 12 weeks postpartum for pregnancies lasting between 24 and 43 weeks. FINDINGS: A total of 757 pregnancies from 733 participants were included. Resting heart rate (RHR) increased across pregnancy, peaking in the third trimester (pre-pregnancy median RHR 65.0 beats per minute [BPM], interquartile range [IQR] 60.0-70.2 B.M. third trimester median RHR 75.5 B.M. IQR 69.0-82.0 B.M., with a decrease prior to delivery and nadir postpartum (postpartum median RHR 62.0 B.M. IQR 57.0-66.0 B.M.. Heart rate variability (HRV) decreased from pre-pregnancy (39.9 milliseconds, IQR 32.6-48.3 milliseconds), reaching a nadir in the third trimester (29.9 milliseconds, IQR 25.2-36.4 milliseconds), before rebounding in the last weeks of pregnancy. Measures of activity, such as exercise minutes, stand minutes, step count and Cardio Fitness were all decreased in each trimester compared to pre-pregnancy, with their nadirs postpartum. Total sleep duration increased slightly in early pregnancy (pre-pregnancy 7.2 hours, IQR 6.7-7.7 hours; 1st trimester 7.4 hours, IQR 6.8-7.9 hours), with the lowest sleep duration postpartum (6.2 hours, IQR 5.4-6.8 hours).

{"id": "PUB_45", "text": "Mapping of Alzheimer's disease related data elements and the NIH Common Data BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a devastating disease that destroys memory and other cognitive functions. There has been an increasing research effort to prevent and treat AD. In the US, two major data sharing resources for AD research are the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); Additionally, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Data Elements (CDE) Repository has been developed to facilitate data sharing and improve the interoperability among data sets in various disease research areas. METHOD: To better understand how AD-related data elements in these resources are interoperable with each other, we leverage different representation models to map data elements from different resources: NACC to ADNI, NACC to NIH CDE, and ADNI to NIH CDE. We explore bag-of-words based and word embeddings based models (Word2Vec and BioWordVec) to perform the data element mappings in these resources. RESULTS: The data dictionaries downloaded on November 23, 2021 contain 1,195 data elements in NACC, 13,918 in ADNI, and 27,213 in NIH CDE Repository. Data element preprocessing reduced the numbers of NACC and ADNI data elements for mapping to 1,099 and 7,584 respectively. Manual evaluation of the mapping results showed that the bag-of-words based approach achieved the best precision, while the BioWordVec based approach attained the best recall. In total, the three approaches mapped 175 out of 1,099 (15.92%) NACC data elements to ADNI; 107 out of 1,099 (9.74%) NACC data elements to NIH CDE; and 171 out of 7,584 (2.25%) ADNI data elements to NIH CDE. CONCLUSIONS: The bag-of-words based and word embeddings based approaches showed promise in mapping AD-related data elements between different resources. Although the mapping approaches need further improvement, our result indicates that there is a critical need to standardize CDEs across these valuable AD research resources in order to maximize the discoveries regarding AD pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment that can be gleaned from them."}
{"id": "PUB_46", "text": "Cardiac Arrest and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Outcome Reports: 2024 Update of The Utstein Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Registry Template, introduced in 1991 and updated in 2004 and 2015, standardizes data collection to enable research, evaluation, and comparisons of systems of care. The impetus for the current update stemmed from significant advances in the field and insights from registry development and regional comparisons. This 2024 update involved representatives of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and used a modified Delphi process. Every 2015 Utstein data element was reviewed for relevance, priority (core or supplemental), and improvement. New variables were proposed and refined. All changes were voted on for inclusion. The 2015 domains-system, dispatch, patient, process, and outcomes-were retained. Further clarity is provided for the definitions of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest attended resuscitation and attempted resuscitation. Changes reflect advancements in dispatch, early response systems, and resuscitation care, as well as the importance of prehospital outcomes. Time intervals such as emergency medical service response time now emphasize precise reporting of the times used. New flowcharts aid the reporting of system effectiveness for patients with an attempted resuscitation and system efficacy for the Utstein comparator group. Recognizing the varying capacities of emergency systems globally, the writing group provided a minimal dataset for settings with developing emergency medical systems. Supplementary variables are considered useful for research purposes. These revisions aim to elevate data collection and reporting transparency by registries and researchers and to advance international comparisons and collaborations. The overarching objective remains the improvement of outcomes for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest."}
{"id": "PUB_47", "text": "Toward Automated Data Extraction According to Tabular Data Structure: BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews depend on time-consuming extraction of data from the PDFs of underlying studies. To date, automation efforts have focused on extracting data from the text, and no approach has yet succeeded in fully automating ingestion of quantitative evidence. However, the majority of relevant data is generally presented in tables, and the tabular structure is more amenable to automated extraction than free text. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to classify the structure and format of descriptive statistics reported in tables in the comparative medical literature. METHODS: We sampled 100 published randomized controlled trials from 2019 based on a search in PubMed; these results were imported to the AutoLit platform. Studies were excluded if they were nonclinical, noncomparative, not in English, protocols, or not available in full text. In AutoLit, tables reporting baseline or outcome data in all studies were characterized based on reporting practices. Measurement context, meaning the structure in which the interventions of interest, patient arm breakdown, measurement time points, and data element descriptions were presented, was classified based on the number of contextual pieces and metadata reported. The statistic formats for reported metrics (specific instances of reporting of data elements) were then classified by location and broken down into reporting strategies for continuous, dichotomous, and categorical metrics. RESULTS: We included 78 of 100 sampled studies, one of which (1.3%) did not report data elements in tables. The remaining 77 studies reported baseline and outcome data in 174 tables, and 96% (69/72) of these tables broke down reporting by patient arms. Fifteen structures were found for the reporting of measurement context, which were broadly grouped into: 1×1 contexts, where two pieces of context are reported in total (eg, arms in columns, data elements in rows); 2×1 contexts, where two pieces of context are given on row headers (eg, time points in columns, arms nested in data elements on rows); and 1×2 contexts, where two pieces of context are given on column headers. The 1×1 contexts were present in 57% of tables (99/174), compared to 20% (34/174) for 2×1 contexts and 15% (26/174) for 1×2 contexts; the remaining 8% (15/174) used unique/other stratification methods. Statistic formats were reported in the headers or descriptions of 84% (65/74) of studies. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional pilot review, we found a high density of information in tables, but with major heterogeneity in presentation of measurement context. The highest-density studies reported both baseline and outcome measures in tables, with arm-level breakout, intervention labels, and arm sizes present, and reported both the statistic formats and units. The measurement context formats presented here, broadly classified into three classes that cover 92% (71/78) of studies, form a basis for understanding the frequency of different reporting styles, supporting automated detection of the data format for extraction of metrics."}
{"id": "PUB_48", "text": "Enhancement and Implementation of a Health Information Technology Module to PURPOSE: Cancer staging is the foundation for all cancer management decisions. For real-time use, stage must be embedded in the electronic health record as a discrete data element. The objectives of this quality improvement (QI) initiative were to (1) identify barriers to utilization of an existing discrete cancer staging module, (2) identify health information technology (HIT) solutions to support discrete capture of cancer staging data, and (3) increase capture across the oncology enterprise in our diverse health system. METHODS: Six sigma QI methodologies were used to define barriers and solutions to improve discrete cancer staging. Design thinking principles informed solution development to test prototypes. Two multidisciplinary teams of disease-specific clinicians within GI and genitourinary conducted phased testing pilots to determine health system solutions. Solutions were expanded to all oncology specialties across our health system. RESULTS: Baseline average discrete staging capture across our health system was 31%. Poor workflow efficiency, limited accountability, and technical design gaps were key barriers to timely, complete staging. Implementation of more than 25 design enhancements to a HIT solution and passive user alerts led to a postimplementation capture rate of 58% across 55 outpatient clinics involving more than 400 clinicians. CONCLUSION: We identified key barriers to discrete data capture and designed solutions through iterative use of QI methodologies and disease-specific pilots. After implementation, discrete capture of cancer staging nearly doubled across our diverse health system. This approach is scalable and transferable to other initiatives to develop and implement clinically relevant HIT solutions across a diverse health system."}
{"id": "PUB_49", "text": "The Importance of Body Part Labeling to Enable Enterprise Imaging: A HIMSS-SIIM In order for enterprise imaging to be successful across a multitude of specialties, systems, and sites, standards are essential to categorize and classify imaging data. The HIMSS-SIIM Enterprise Imaging Community believes that the Digital Imaging Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Anatomic Region Sequence, or its equivalent in other data standards, is a vital data element for this role, when populated with standard coded values. We believe that labeling images with standard Anatomic Region Sequence codes will enhance the user's ability to consume data, facilitate interoperability, and allow greater control of privacy. Image consumption-when a user views a patient's images, he or she often wants to see relevant comparison images of the same lesion or anatomic region for the same patient automatically presented. Relevant comparison images may have been acquired from a variety of modalities and specialties. The Anatomic Region Sequence data element provides a basis to allow for efficient comparison in both instances. Interoperability-as patients move between health care systems, it is important to minimize friction for data transfer. Health care providers and facilities need to be able to consume and review the increasingly large and complex volume of data efficiently. The use of Anatomic Region Sequence, or its equivalent, populated with standard values enables seamless interoperability of imaging data regardless of whether images are used within a site or across different sites and systems. Privacy-as more visible light photographs are integrated into electronic systems, it becomes apparent that some images may need to be sequestered. Although additional work is needed to protect sensitive images, standard coded values in Anatomic Region Sequence support the identification of potentially sensitive images, enable facilities to create access control policies, and can be used as an interim surrogate for more sophisticated rule-based or attribute-based access control mechanisms. To satisfy such use cases, the HIMSS-SIIM Enterprise Imaging Community encourages the use of a pre-existing body part ontology. Through this white paper, we will identify potential challenges in employing this standard and provide potential solutions for these challenges."}
{"id": "PUB_50", "text": "Semiparametric predictive inference for failure data using first-hitting-time The progression of disease for an individual can be described mathematically as a stochastic process. The individual experiences a failure event when the disease path first reaches or crosses a critical disease level. This happening defines a failure event and a first hitting time or time-to-event, both of which are important in medical contexts. When the context involves explanatory variables then there is usually an interest in incorporating regression structures into the analysis and the methodology known as threshold regression comes into play. To date, most applications of threshold regression have been based on parametric families of stochastic processes. This paper presents a semiparametric form of threshold regression that requires the stochastic process to have only one key property, namely, stationary independent increments. As this property is frequently encountered in real applications, this model has potential for use in many fields. The mathematical underpinnings of this semiparametric approach for estimation and prediction are described. The basic data element required by the model is a pair of readings representing the observed change in time and the observed change in disease level, arising from either a failure event or survival of the individual to the end of the data record. An extension is presented for applications where the underlying disease process is unobservable but component covariate processes are available to construct a surrogate disease process. Threshold regression, used in combination with a data technique called Markov decomposition, allows the methods to handle longitudinal time-to-event data by uncoupling a longitudinal record into a sequence of single records. Computational aspects of the methods are straightforward. An array of simulation experiments that verify computational feasibility and statistical inference are reported in an online supplement. Case applications based on longitudinal observational data from The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) study are presented to demonstrate the methodology and its practical use."}

However, variable HMIS data quality in low- and middle-income countries limits its value in monitoring, evaluation and research. We aimed to review the quality of Rwandan HMIS data for maternal and newborn health (MNH) based on consistency of HMIS reports with facility source documents. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 76 health facilities (HFs) in four Rwandan districts. For 14 MNH data elements, we compared HMIS data to facility register data recounted by study staff for a three-month period in 2017. A HF was excluded from a specific comparison if the service was not offered, source documents were unavailable or at least one HMIS report was missing for the study period. World Health Organization guidelines on HMIS data verification were used: a verification factor (VF) was defined as the ratio of register over HMIS data. A VF<0.90 or VF>1.10 indicated over- and under-reporting in HMIS, respectively. RESULTS: High proportions of HFs achieved acceptable VFs for data on the number of deliveries (98.7%;75/76), antenatal care (ANC1) new registrants (95.7%;66/69), live births (94.7%;72/76), and newborns who received first postnatal care within 24 hours (81.5%;53/65). This was slightly lower for the number of women who received iron/folic acid (78.3%;47/60) and tested for syphilis in ANC1 (67.6%;45/68) and was the lowest for the number of women with ANC1 standard visit (25.0%;17/68) and fourth standard visit (ANC4) (17.4%;12/69). The majority of HFs over-reported on ANC4 (76.8%;53/69) and ANC1 (64.7%;44/68) standard visits. CONCLUSION: There was variable HMIS data quality by data element, with some indicators with high quality and also consistency in reporting trends across districts. Over-reporting was observed for ANC-related data requiring more complex calculations, i.e., knowledge of gestational age, scheduling to determine ANC standard visits, as well as quality indicators in ANC. Ongoing data quality assessments and training to address gaps could help improve HMIS data quality."}

HEAL is an ambitious, NIH-wide initiative to speed scientific solutions to stem the national opioid public health crisis. The RE-JOIN consortium's over-arching goal is to define how chronic joint pain-mediating neurons innervate different articular and peri-articular tissues, with a focus on the knee and temporomandibular joints (TMJ) across species employing the latest neuroscience approaches. The aim of this manuscript is to elucidate the human data gathered by the RE-JOIN consortium, as well as to expound upon its underlying rationale and the methodologies and protocols for harmonization and standardization that have been instituted by the RE-JOIN Consortium. METHODS: The consortium-wide human models working subgroup established the RE-JOIN minimal harmonized data elements that will be collected across all human studies and set the stage to develop parallel pre-clinical data collection standards. Data harmonization considerations included requirements from the HEAL program and recommendations from the consortium's researchers and experts on informatics, knowledge management, and data curation. RESULTS: Multidisciplinary experts - including preclinical and clinical researchers, with both clinician-scientists- developed the RE-JOIN's Minimal Human Data Standard with required domains and outcome measures to be collected across projects and institutions. The RE-JOIN minimal data standard will include HEAL Common Data Elements (CDEs) (e.g., standardized demographics, general pain, psychosocial and functional measures), and RE-JOIN common data elements (R-CDE) (i.e., both general and joint-specific standardized and clinically important self-reported pain and function measures, as well as pressure pain thresholds part of quantitative sensory testing). In addition, discretionary, site-specific measures will be collected by individual institutions (e.g., expanded quantitative sensory testing and gait biomechanical assessments), specific to the knee or TMJ. Research teams will submit datasets of standardized metadata to the RE-JOIN Data Coordinating Center (DCG) via a secure cloud-based central data repository and computing infrastructure for researchers to share and conduct analyses on data collected by or acquired for RE-JOIN. RE-JOIN datasets will have protected health information (PHI) removed and be publicly available on the SPARC portal and accessible through the HEAL Data Ecosystem. CONCLUSION: Data Harmonization efforts provide the multidisciplinary consortium with an opportunity to effectively collaborate across decentralized research teams, and data standardization sets the framework for efficient future analyses of RE-JOIN data collected by the consortium. The harmonized phenotypic information obtained will significantly enhance our understanding of the neurobiology of the pain-pathology relationships in humans, providing valuable insights for comparison with pre-clinical models."}
{"id": "PUB_53", "text": "Common Data Element for Disorders of Consciousness: Recommendations from the BACKGROUND: Over the past 30 years, there have been significant advances in the understanding of the mechanisms associated with loss and recovery of consciousness following severe brain injury. This work has provided a strong grounding for the development of novel restorative therapeutic interventions. Although all interventions are aimed at modulating and thereby restoring brain function, the landscape of existing interventions encompasses a very wide scope of techniques and protocols. Despite vigorous research efforts, few approaches have been assessed with rigorous, high-quality randomized controlled trials. As a growing number of exploratory interventions emerge, it is paramount to develop standardized approaches to reporting results. The successful evaluation of novel interventions depends on implementation of shared nomenclature and infrastructure. To address this gap, the Neurocritical Care Society's Curing Coma Campaign convened nine working groups and charged them with developing common data elements (CDEs). Here, we report the work of the Therapeutic Interventions Working Group. METHODS: The working group reviewed existing CDEs relevant to therapeutic interventions within the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke database and reviewed the literature for assessing key areas of research in the intervention space. CDEs were then proposed, iteratively discussed and reviewed, classified, and organized in a case report form (CRF). RESULTS: We developed a unified CRF, including CDEs and key design elements (i.e., methodological or protocol parameters), divided into five sections: (1) patient information, (2) general study information, (3) behavioral interventions, (4) pharmacological interventions, and (5) device interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The newly created CRF enhances systematization of future work by proposing a portfolio of measures that should be collected in the development and implementation of studies assessing novel interventions intended to increase the level of consciousness or rate of recovery of consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness."}

Constructing clinical knowledge graphs (CKGs) against heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs) has been desired by the research and healthcare AI communities. From the standardization perspective, community-based standards such as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) are increasingly used to represent and standardize EHR data for clinical data analytics, however, the potential of such a standard on building CKG has not been well investigated. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate methods and tools that expose the OMOP CDM-based clinical data repositories into virtual clinical KGs that are compliant with FHIR Resource Description Framework (RDF) specification. METHODS: We developed a system called FHIR-Ontop-OMOP to generate virtual clinical KGs from the OMOP relational databases. We leveraged an OMOP CDM-based Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) data repository to evaluate the FHIR-Ontop-OMOP system in terms of the faithfulness of data transformation and the conformance of the generated CKGs to the FHIR RDF specification. RESULTS: A beta version of the system has been released. A total of more than 100 data element mappings from 11 OMOP CDM clinical data, health system and vocabulary tables were implemented in the system, covering 11 FHIR resources. The generated virtual CKG from MIMIC-III contains 46,520 instances of FHIR Patient, 716,595 instances of Condition, 1,063,525 instances of Procedure, 24,934,751 instances of MedicationStatement, 365,181,104 instances of Observations, and 4,779,672 instances of CodeableConcept. Patient counts identified by five pairs of SQL (over the MIMIC database) and SPARQL (over the virtual CKG) queries were identical, ensuring the faithfulness of the data transformation. Generated CKG in RDF triples for 100 patients were fully conformant with the FHIR RDF specification. CONCLUSION: The FHIR-Ontop-OMOP system can expose OMOP database as a FHIR-compliant RDF graph. It provides a meaningful use case demonstrating the potentials that can be enabled by the interoperability between FHIR and OMOP CDM. Generated clinical KGs in FHIR RDF provide a semantic foundation to enable explainable AI applications in healthcare."}

The main goal was to help health centers enhance the quality of their malaria data. The assessment involved reviewing data from outpatient registers, monthly reports, and DHIS2 data. Reporting timeliness, completeness, data element completeness, and availability of source documents were assessed. For timeliness, the assessment measured the proportion of reports that were submitted on time out of the expected total. The results showed that the reporting timeliness was inadequate in Atsinanana (85%) and adequate for Atsimo-Andrefana (95%). Data elements completeness, which refers to reports without missing data, was inadequate in Atsinanana (43%) and Atsimo-Andrefana (68%). The availability of source documents, such as records forms, was assessed and found to be 59% in Atsimo-Andrefana and 48% in Atsinanana. The use of standard reporting forms, which ensures consistency and accuracy in reporting, was reported to be 44% in Atsinanana and 54% in Atsimo-Andrefana. Data discrepancies were identified between outpatient registers, monthly reports, and DHIS2 data. A verification factor (VF) was used to compare the figures in these different sources. The VF was 1.2 in Atsinanana and 1.1 in Atsimo-Andrefana for both monthly reports and DHIS2 data, indicating an overreporting of fever cases tested in 6- to 13-year-olds. Overall, the assessment revealed gaps in data elements completeness, reporting accuracy, and availability of data recording guidelines. The findings suggest that regular data quality assessments should be implemented to guide decision making in Madagascar."}
{"id": "PUB_56", "text": "Planning for health information exchange: Perspectives of community pharmacists BACKGROUND: Community pharmacists are one of the most accessible health professionals and provide many different services. However, lack of access to complete patient information is a barrier to making meaningful patient interventions. OBJECTIVES: To determine (1) current and desired health information access among community pharmacists in the Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Network (CPESN) of Indiana and (2) design considerations for a health information exchange tool for use by community pharmacists. METHODS: This voluntary study was conducted over an 8-day survey period in which 40 pharmacies within the CPESN Indiana network were contacted during regular business hours and asked to take part in a 15-minute telephone survey. Questions asked were informed by the following Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research intervention characteristics domain constructs: relative advantage, evidence strength and quality, adaptability, trialability, complexity, costs, and design quality and packaging. RESULTS: Of the 40 contacted pharmacies, 32 (80%) completed the survey. Most pharmacies reported access to immunization registry data; no other routine access was reported by any pharmacy. In questions assessing the relative advantage of Health Information Exchange (HIE) access compared with their current information access, at least 84.4% said that they agreed or strongly agreed with all statements. When choosing the data element most desirable to have access to via HIE in a community pharmacy, the most frequently selected choices were updated medication orders (n = 18, 56.3%), progress notes (n = 5, 15.6%), and laboratory tests (n = 4, 12.5%). Suggestions to improve ease of implementation included integration within dispensing software and clinical decision-making support features, such as alerts for pertinent lab values. CONCLUSION: Integrating HIE data into community pharmacies would provide community pharmacists with access to important patient data, and pharmacists believed that this would improve their practice. Future research should explore whether implementation of this type of tool leads to better patient outcomes and improved pharmacist job satisfaction."}

We analyzed clinical trial registry data from ClinicalTrials.gov (CTG) and determined the proportion of trials sharing de-identified Individual Participant Data (IPD). We looked at 3,138 medical conditions (as Medical Subject Heading terms). Overall, 10.8% of trials with first registration date after December 1, 2015 answered 'Yes' to plan to share de-identified IPD data. This sharing rate ranges between 0% (biliary tract neoplasms) to 72.2% (meningitis, meningococcal) when analyzed by disease that is focus of a study. Via a predictive model, we found that studies that deposited basic summary results data to CTG results registry, large studies and phase 3 interventional studies are most likely to declare intent to share IPD data. As part of an HIV common data element analysis project, we further compared a body of HIV trials (24% sharing rate) to other diseases."}
{"id": "PUB_58", "text": "Common Design and Data Elements Reported on Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension BACKGROUND: There are an increasing number of controlled clinical trials and prospective studies, ongoing and recently completed, regarding management options for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We present a Common Design and Data Element (CDDE) analysis of controlled and prospective IIH studies with the aim of aligning essential design and recommending data elements in future trials and enhancing data synthesis potential in IIH trials. METHODS: We used PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov to screen for ongoing and published trials assessing treatment modalities in people with IIH. After our search, we used the Nested Knowledge AutoLit platform to extract pertinent information regarding each study. We examined outputs from each study and synthesized the data elements to determine the degree of homogeneity between studies. RESULTS: The most CDDE for inclusion criteria was the modified Dandy criteria for diagnosis of IIH, used in 9/14 studies (64%). The most CDDE for outcomes was change in visual function, reported in 12/14 studies (86%). Evaluation of surgical procedures (venous sinus stenting, cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement, and others) was more common, seen in 9/14 studies (64%) as compared with interventions with medical therapy 6/14 (43%). CONCLUSIONS: Although all studies have similar focus to improve patient care, there was a high degree of inconsistency among studies regarding inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and outcomes measures. Furthermore, studies used different time frames to assess outcome data elements. This heterogeneity will make it difficult to achieve a consistent standard, and thus, making secondary analyses and meta-analyses less effective in the future. Consensus on design of trials is an unmet research need for IIH."}

This study presents a methodology to comprehensively capture the clinical trial data element needs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case report forms (CRF) for clinical trial data collection were used to approximate the clinical information need, whereby these information needs were then mapped to a semantically equivalent field within an existing FHIR cancer profile. For items without a semantically equivalent field, we considered these items to be information needs that cannot be represented in current standards and proposed extensions to support these needs. RESULTS: We successfully identified 62 discrete items from a preliminary survey of 43 base questions in four CRFs used in colorectal cancer clinical trials, in which 28 items are modeled with FHIR extensions and their associated responses for colorectal cancer. We achieved promising results in the data population of the CRFs with average Precision 98.5 %, Recall 96.2 %, and F-measure 96.8 % for all base questions. We also demonstrated the auto-filled answers in CRFs can be used to discover patient subgroups using a topic modeling approach. CONCLUSION: CRFs can be considered as a proxy for representing information needs for their respective cancer types. Mining the information needs can serve as a valuable resource for expanding existing standards to ensure they can comprehensively represent relevant clinical data without loss of granularity."}

A lay-counselling service located at primary health care (PHC) level could potentially help to close the large treatment gap for common mental disorders in South Africa. The aim of this study was to understand multilevel factors contributing to implementation and potential dissemination of such a service for depression at PHC level. METHODS: Process qualitative data of the lay-counselling service for patients with depressive symptoms was collected alongside a pragmatic randomized controlled trial evaluating a collaborative care model that included a lay-counselling service for patients with depressive symptoms. Semi-structured key informant interviews (SSI) were conducted with a purposive sample of PHC providers (lay-counsellors, nurse practitioners, operational managers), lay-counsellor supervisors, district and provincial managers, and patients in receipt of services. A total of 86 interviews were conducted. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to guide data collection as well as Framework Analysis to determine barriers and facilitators for implementation and dissemination of the lay-counselling service. RESULTS: Facilitators identified include supervision and support available for counsellors; person focused counselling approach; organizational integration of the counsellor within facilities. Barriers included lack of organizational support of the counselling service, including lack of counselling dedicated space; high counsellor turnover, resulting in a counsellor not available all the time; lack of an identified cadre to deliver the intervention in the system; and treatment of mental health conditions including counselling not included within mental health indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Several system level issues need to be addressed to promote integration and dissemination of lay-counselling services within PHC facilities in South Africa. Key system requirements are facility organizational readiness for improvement of integration of lay-counselling services; formal recognition of counselling services provided by lay counsellors as well as inclusion of lay counselling as a treatment modality within mental health treatment data element definitions and the need for diversification of the roles of psychologists to include training and supervision of lay counsellors was also emphasized."}
{"id": "PUB_61", "text": "Developing a Dietary Lifestyle Ontology to Improve the Interoperability of BACKGROUND: Dietary habits offer crucial information on one's health and form a considerable part of the patient-generated health data. Dietary data are collected through various channels and formats; thus, interoperability is a significant challenge to reusing this type of data. The vast scope of dietary concepts and the colloquial expression style add difficulty to standardizing the data. The interoperability issues of dietary data can be addressed through Common Data Elements with metadata annotation to some extent. However, making culture-specific dietary habits and questionnaire-based dietary assessment data interoperable still requires substantial efforts. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study was to address the interoperability challenge of questionnaire-based dietary data from different cultural backgrounds by combining ontological curation and metadata annotation of dietary concepts. Specifically, this study aimed to develop a Dietary Lifestyle Ontology (DILON) and demonstrate the improved interoperability of questionnaire-based dietary data by annotating its main semantics with DILON. METHODS: By analyzing 1158 dietary assessment data elements (367 in Korean and 791 in English), 515 dietary concepts were extracted and used to construct DILON. To demonstrate the utility of DILON in addressing the interoperability challenges of questionnaire-based multicultural dietary data, we developed 10 competency questions that asked to identify data elements sharing the same dietary topics and assessment properties. We instantiated 68 data elements on dietary habits selected from Korean and English questionnaires and annotated them with DILON to answer the competency questions. We translated the competency questions into Semantic Query-Enhanced Web Rule Language and reviewed the query results for accuracy. RESULTS: DILON was built with 262 concept classes and validated with ontology validation tools. A small overlap (72 concepts) in the concepts extracted from the questionnaires in 2 languages indicates that we need to pay closer attention to representing culture-specific dietary concepts. The Semantic Query-Enhanced Web Rule Language queries reflecting the 10 competency questions yielded correct results. CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring the interoperability of dietary lifestyle data is a demanding task due to its vast scope and variations in expression. This study demonstrated that we could improve the interoperability of dietary data generated in different cultural contexts and expressed in various styles by annotating their core semantics with DILON."}
{"id": "PUB_62", "text": "Facilitating clinical research through automation: Combining optical character BACKGROUND/AIMS: Performance status is crucial for most clinical research, as an eligibility criterion, a comorbidity covariate, or a trial endpoint. Yet information on performance status often is embedded as free text within a patient's electronic medical record, rather than coded directly, thereby making this concept extremely difficult to extract for research. Furthermore, performance status information frequently resides in outside reports, which are scanned into the electronic medical record along with thousands of clinic notes. The image format of scanned documents also is a major obstacle to the search and retrieval of information, as natural language processing cannot be applied to unstructured text within an image. We, therefore, utilized optical character recognition software to convert images to a searchable format, allowing the application of natural language processing to identify pertinent performance status data elements within scanned electronic medical records. METHODS: Our study cohort consisted of 189 subjects diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for whom performance status was a required data element for analysis of prognostic factors related to recurrence and survival. Manual abstraction of performance status was previously conducted by a clinical Subject Matter Expert, serving as the gold standard. Leveraging our data warehouse, we extracted relevant scanned electronic medical record documents and applied optical character recognition to these images using the ABBYY FineReader software. The Linguamatics i2e natural language processing software was then used to run queries for performance status against the corpus of electronic medical record documents. We evaluated our optical character recognition/natural language processing pipeline for accuracy and reduction in data extraction effort. RESULTS: We found that there was high accuracy and reduced time for extraction of performance status data by applying our optical character recognition/natural language processing pipeline. The transformed scanned documents from a random sample of patients yielded excellent precision, recall, and F score, with <1% incorrect results. Time savings from a second cohort showed that median time to review documents for patients with performance status data present was reduced by a third. The major time savings was in the review of those documents that in fact did not contain performance status information: median of 18 minutes versus 108 minutes for manual review, an 83% reduction in data abstraction effort. CONCLUSION: By applying this optical character recognition/natural language processing pipeline, we achieved significant operational improvement and reduced time for information retrieval to support clinical research. Our study demonstrated that optical character recognition software provides an effective mechanism to transform scanned electronic medical record images to allow the application of natural language processing, yielding highly accurate data abstraction. We conclude that our optical character recognition/natural language processing pipeline can greatly facilitate research data abstraction by providing a highly focused data review, eliminating unnecessary manual review of the entire chart, and thus freeing time for abstracting other data elements requiring more human interpretation."}
{"id": "PUB_63", "text": "An Environmental Scan of Sex and Gender in Electronic Health Records: Analysis of BACKGROUND: Historically, the terms sex and gender have been used interchangeably as a binary attribute to describe a person as male or female, even though there is growing recognition that sex and gender are distinct concepts. The lack of sex and gender delineation in electronic health records (EHRs) may be perpetuating the inequities experienced by the transgender and gender nonbinary (TGNB) populations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct an environmental scan to understand how sex and gender are defined and implemented in existing Canadian EHRs and current international health information standards. METHODS: We examined public information sources on sex and gender definitions in existing Canadian EHRs and international standards communities. Definitions refer to data element names, code systems, and value sets in the descriptions of EHRs and standards. The study was built on an earlier environment scan by Canada Health Infoway, supplemented with sex and gender definitions from international standards communities. For the analysis, we examined the definitions for clarity, consistency, and accuracy. We also received feedback from a virtual community interested in sex-gender EHR issues. RESULTS: The information sources consisted of public website descriptions of 52 databases and 55 data standards from 12 Canadian entities and 10 standards communities. There are variations in the definition and implementation of sex and gender in Canadian EHRs and international health information standards. There is a lack of clarity in some sex and gender concepts. There is inconsistency in the data element names, code systems, and value sets used to represent sex and gender concepts across EHRs. The appropriateness and adequacy of some value options are questioned as our societal understanding of sexual health evolves. Outdated value options raise concerns about current EHRs supporting the provision of culturally competent, safe, and affirmative health care. The limited options also perpetuate the inequities faced by the TGNB populations. The expanded sex and gender definitions from leading Canadian organizations and international standards communities have brought challenges in how to migrate these definitions into existing EHRs. We proposed 6 high-level actions, which are to articulate the need for this work, reach consensus on sex and gender concepts, reach consensus on expanded sex and gender definitions in EHRs, develop a coordinated action plan, embrace EHR change from socio-organizational and technical aspects to ensure success, and demonstrate the benefits in tangible terms. CONCLUSIONS: There are variations in sex and gender concepts across Canadian EHRs and the health information standards that support them. Although there are efforts to modernize sex and gender concept definitions, we need decisive and coordinated actions to ensure clarity, consistency, and competency in the definition and implementation of sex and gender concepts in EHRs. This work has implications for addressing the inequities of TGNB populations in Canada."}

Treatment for IH has traditionally consisted of dietary and conservative medical management, focal treatments including banding and sclerotherapy or hemorrhoidectomy. Recently, rectal artery embolization (RAE) has been studied as a potential treatment for bleeding predominant IH. We performed a common design and data element analysis of studies that report on RAE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a qualitative systematic literature review for rectal artery embolization (RAE) for symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease. The screening process involved five online databases (PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, DOAJ, and Scopus). Additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov was examined for active, unpublished completed studies. The initial search yielded 2000 studies, with 15 studies meeting the inclusion criteria after screening and assessment. The included studies comprised one RCT, one case series, one pilot study and 12 cohort studies. RESULTS: The population analysis revealed a male predominance across all studies, with varying cohort sizes. The baseline Goligher hemorrhoid grade was utilized in 80% of studies. The majority (73.3%) employed a transfemoral approach, and coils were the primary embolic material in 60% of studies, 26.6% were combination of coils and particles, and 6.6% were particles only. Patient selection criteria highlighted RAE's applicability for high surgical risk patients and those with anemia, chronic hematochezia, or treatment-refractory cases. Exclusion criteria emphasized factors such as previous surgeries, colorectal cancer, rectal prolapse, acute hemorrhoidal complications, and contrast allergy. Study designs varied, with cohort studies being the most common (12/15; 80%). Procedural details included the use of metallic coils and detachable micro-coils, with a high technical success rate reported in most studies ranging from 72 to 100%. The follow-up ranged from 1 to 18 months. The majority of studies reported no major immediate or post-procedural complications. CONCLUSION: While all studies focused on RAE as a treatment for IH, there was a great degree of heterogeneity among included studies, particularly regarding inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, outcomes measures and timeframe. Future literature should attempt to standardize these design elements to help facilitate secondary analyses and increase understanding of RAE as a treatment option."}
{"id": "PUB_65", "text": "Feasibility Study of Federated Learning on the Distributed Research Network of OBJECTIVES: Since protecting patients' privacy is a major concern in clinical research, there has been a growing need for privacy-preserving data analysis platforms. For this purpose, a federated learning (FL) method based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) was implemented, and its feasibility was demonstrated. METHODS: We implemented an FL platform on FeederNet, which is a distributed clinical data analysis platform based on the OMOP CDM in Korea. We trained it through an artificial neural network (ANN) using data from patients who received steroid prescriptions or injections, with the aim of predicting the occurrence of side effects depending on the prescribed dose. The ANN was trained using the FL platform with the OMOP CDMs of Kyung Hee University Medical Center (KHMC) and Ajou University Hospital (AUH). RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) for predicting bone fracture, osteonecrosis, and osteoporosis using only data from each hospital were 0.8426, 0.6920, and 0.7727 for KHMC and 0.7891, 0.7049, and 0.7544 for AUH, respectively. In contrast, when using FL, the corresponding AUROCs were 0.8260, 0.7001, and 0.7928 for KHMC and 0.7912, 0.8076, and 0.7441 for AUH, respectively. In particular, FL led to a 14% improvement in performance for osteonecrosis at AUH. CONCLUSIONS: FL can be performed with the OMOP CDM, and FL often shows better performance than using only a single institution's data. Therefore, research using OMOP CDM has been expanded from statistical analysis to machine learning so that researchers can conduct more diverse research."}

These policies also had an economic impact. Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) already experience higher incidences of depression, anxiety, social isolation, and job loss, and the continuing pandemic may exacerbate these. METHODS: Between November 2, 2020, and February 12, 2021, 233 individuals with MS completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the modified Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, the Centers for Disease Control/National Institutes of Health Common Data Element Repository economic impact questions, and study team-designed questions about social and family relationships and adherence to public health policies. RESULTS: Study participants reported high rates of mask wearing, good hand hygiene, and limited interactions with those outside their homes. They felt isolated from family they did not live with, friends, and coworkers. The frequency of conflicts with their spouses/partners increased \"a little\" among 20% of respondents, but overall relationships with housemates were \"unchanged\" or \"a little better.\" Ninety-one percent of participants reported experiencing no financial impact. On the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 16.0% of 218 respondents reported depressive symptoms and 26.8% of 216 reported symptoms of anxiety above the commonly accepted clinically significant cutoff points. Only 3.4% of participants reported contracting SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: During the first year of the pandemic, this study found no pronounced impact on the emotional, social, or economic stability of the individuals with MS it surveyed. It seems that these study participants adapted to the restrictions created by the pandemic and, by adhering to guidelines, protected themselves from contracting SARS-CoV-2."}

METHOD: Survey data were collected from PAs to determine the documentation method used to record outpatient encounters. For clinicians using electronic-assisted documentation, information on the documentation style (including format of documentation, accuracy of generated encounters, and overall readability of encounters) was quantitatively measured. RESULTS: 129 PAs completed the survey and met the inclusion criteria of documenting outpatient encounters using an electronically assisted format. A statistically significant shift (P < .001) in documentation style from free-text formatted entries to structured data entry was seen as the volume of daily patient encounters increased. A statistically significant (P < .001) decrease in both accuracy and readability was noted with encounters using a structured data entry format. CONCLUSION: In outpatient settings, a volume-dependent shift to structured data element documentation despite self-assessed deficiencies in both accuracy and readability was noted. This shift has the potential to negatively affect the integrity of medical documentation and raises patient safety concerns."}

Toward this end, the NIH HEAL Initiative launched a common data element (CDE) program to ensure that NIH-funded clinical pain research studies would collect data in a standardized way. NIH HEAL Initiative staff launched a process to determine which pain-related core domains should be assessed by every clinical pain study and what questionnaires are required to ensure that the data is collected uniformly. The process involved multiple literature reviews, and consultation with experts inside and outside of NIH and the investigators conducting studies funded by the initiative. Ultimately, 9 core pain domains, and questionnaires to measure them, were chosen for studies examining acute pain and chronic pain in adults and pediatric populations. These were augmented with dozens of study-specific supplemental questionnaires to enable uniform data collection methods of outcomes outside of the core domains. The selection of core domains will ensure that valuable clinical pain data generated by the initiative is standardized, useable for secondary data analysis, and useful for guiding future research, clinical practice decisions, and policymaking.

High-income countries have made progress in prevention, while LMIC face unacceptably high incidence and mortality rates, often lacking official screening recommendations. We analysed the presence and content of cervical cancer screening guidelines for the secondary prevention of cervical cancer in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and compared it to the current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for screening and treatment of cervical pre-cancer lesions for cervical cancer prevention. METHODS: A review of national cervical cancer guidelines across the SADC region was conducted. Data was obtained from government websites, international cancer control platforms, and WHO resources. Search terms included \"cervical cancer\" and \"cervical cancer control guidelines\", amongst others. There were no limitations on publication years, and the most recent versions of the guidelines were analysed, regardless of language. Each guideline was assessed for specific screening and treatment recommendations, in relation to the current WHO guidelines. Points were assigned for each data element. RESULTS: While most countries contributed data to this analysis there was a notable absence of adherence to the WHO guidelines. The most common screening method was naked eye visual inspection. There was a consensus on the age of screening initiation. Most countries recommended treatment by cryotherapy and loop excision. CONCLUSION: Effective cervical cancer screening programmes, guided by evidence-based recommendations, can enhance early intervention and outcomes. This study highlights the need for standardized and evidence-based cervical cancer screening guidelines in the SADC region, to reduce the burden of cervical cancer and improve the health outcomes of women in these areas."}

The primary objective of the current study was to prospectively examine structural brain changes (cortical thickness and subcortical volumes) and age-at-injury effects. A priori study hypotheses predicted reduced cortical thickness and hippocampal volumes up to 4 months postinjury, which would be inversely associated with age at injury. METHODS: Prospective cohort study design with consecutive recruitment. Study inclusion adapted from American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (upper threshold) and Zurich Concussion in Sport Group (minimal threshold) and diagnosed by Emergency Department and Urgent Care clinicians. Major neurologic, psychiatric, or developmental disorders were exclusionary. Clinical (Common Data Element) and structural (3 T MRI) evaluations within 11 days (subacute visit [SA]) and at 4 months (early chronic visit [EC]) postinjury. Age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) to control for repeat testing/neurodevelopment. Clinical outcomes based on self-report and cognitive testing. Structural images quantified with FreeSurfer (version 7.1.1). RESULTS: A total of 208 patients with pmTBI (age = 14.4 ± 2.9; 40.4% female) and 176 HC (age = 14.2 ± 2.9; 42.0% female) were included in the final analyses (>80% retention). Reduced cortical thickness (right rostral middle frontal gyrus; d = -0.49) and hippocampal volumes (d = -0.24) observed for pmTBI, but not associated with age at injury. Hippocampal volume recovery was mediated by loss of consciousness/posttraumatic amnesia. Significantly greater postconcussive symptoms and cognitive deficits were observed at SA and EC visits, but were not associated with the structural abnormalities. Structural abnormalities slightly improved balanced classification accuracy above and beyond clinical gold standards (∆+3.9%), with a greater increase in specificity (∆+7.5%) relative to sensitivity (∆+0.3%). DISCUSSION: Current findings indicate that structural brain abnormalities may persist up to 4 months post-pmTBI and are partially mediated by initial markers of injury severity. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting prolonged physiologic recovery post-pmTBI. In contrast, there was no evidence for age-at-injury effects or physiologic correlates of persistent symptoms in our sample."}

Having the right metadata is crucial for answering the particular research questions. Furthermore, the set of data elements determines the registries' readiness of interoperability and data reusability to a major extent. Six health registries shared and published their metadata within a German funding initiative. As one step in the direction of a common set of data elements, a selection of those metadata was evaluated with regard to their appropriateness for a broader usage. METHODS: Each registry was asked to contribute a 10%-selection of their data elements to an evaluation sample. The survey was set up with the online survey tool \"LimeSurvey Cloud\". The registries and an accompanying project participated in the survey with one vote for each project. The data elements were offered in content groups along with the question of whether the data element is appropriate for health registries on a broader scale. The question could be answered using a Likert scale with five options. Furthermore, \"no answer\" was allowed. The level of agreement was assessed using weighted Cohen's kappa and Kendall's coefficient of concordance. RESULTS: The evaluation sample consisted of 269 data elements. With a grade of \"perhaps recommendable\" or higher in the mean, 169 data elements were selected. These data elements belong preferably to groups' demography, education/occupation, medication, and nutrition. Half of the registries lost significance compared with their percentage of data elements in the evaluation sample, one remained stable. The level of concordance was adequate. CONCLUSIONS: The survey revealed a set of 169 data elements recommended for health registries. When developing a registry, this set could be valuable help in selecting the metadata appropriate to answer the registry's research questions. However, due to the high specificity of research questions, data elements beyond this set will be needed to cover the whole range of interests of a register. A broader discussion and subsequent surveys are needed to establish a common set of data elements on an international scale."}
{"id": "PUB_74", "text": "Development of a standards-based phenotype model for gross motor function to INTRODUCTION: Research and continuous quality improvement in pediatric rehabilitation settings require standardized data and a systematic approach to use these data. METHODS: We systematically examined pediatric data concepts from a pediatric learning network to determine capacity for capturing gross motor function (GMF) for children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) as a demonstration for enabling infrastructure for research and quality improvement activities of an LHS. We used an iterative approach to construct phenotype models of GMF from standardized data element concepts based on case definitions from the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Data concepts were selected using a theory and expert-informed process and resulted in the construction of four phenotype models of GMF: an overall model and three classes corresponding to deviations in GMF for CP populations. RESULTS: Sixty five data element concepts were identified for the overall GMF phenotype model. The 65 data elements correspond to 20 variables and logic statements that instantiate membership into one of three clinically meaningful classes of GMF. Data element concepts and variables are organized into five domains relevant to modeling GMF: Neurologic Function, Mobility Performance, Activity Performance, Motor Performance, and Device Use. CONCLUSION: Our experience provides an approach for organizations to leverage existing data for care improvement and research in other conditions. This is the first consensus-based and theory-driven specification of data elements and logic to support identification and labeling of GMF in patients for measuring improvements in care or the impact of new treatments. More research is needed to validate this phenotype model and the extent that these data differentiate between classes of GMF to support various LHS activities."}

METHODS: We applied quality improvement methodology to develop a more reliable and accurate system to identify patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and track important measures that aide in improving patient care and performance outcomes. From 2019 to 2021, we iteratively modified our outpatient clinic EHR note to include structured data elements to improve longitudinal monitoring. We then validated data transferred to an electronic dashboard external to the EHR and demonstrated utility for identifying an accurate patient population and tracking quality improvement initiatives. RESULTS: Creation of the structured data elements improved the identification of patients with JIA with >99% accuracy and without requiring manual review of the chart. Using the dashboard to monitor performance, we improved documentation of critical disease activity measures that resulted in improvement in those scores across the local population of patients with JIA. The structured data elements also enabled us to automate electronic data transfer to a multicenter learning network registry. CONCLUSION: The structured data element modifications made to our outpatient EHR note populate a local dashboard that allows real time access to critical information for patient care, population management, and improvement in quality metrics. The collection and monitoring of structured data can be scaled to other quality improvement initiatives in our clinic and shared with other centers."}

Without proper care, this complication can lead to profound psychological challenges and even death. The aim of this study is to design a minimum data set (MDS) for BD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in two steps. In the first step, a survey was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases to identify the demographic, managerial, and clinical data elements. Then, the required data elements were extracted from the studies by the data extraction form and used in a questionnaire. In the second step, to confirm the data element set, the designed questionnaire was distributed and collected among 20 psychiatrists and subspecialists during a two-stage Delphi technique. Descriptive statistics (frequency and mean) were conducted to analyze the data. RESULTS: Totally, 112 managerial and clinical data elements in 14 categories were extracted from the studies. Based on the experts' opinion and their consensus, 88 necessary data elements were considered to bipolar MDS. \"Medication nonadherence,\" \"history of suicide,\" and \"substance abuse and addiction\" were the most important data elements. CONCLUSION: In this study, an MDS was designed for BD. Providing this MDS, in addition to improving the clinical processes, it is possible to help electronic system designers and health data managers to know what information should be included in the health systems or any kind of self-care or self-management software to meet the information needs of these patients."}

This systematic review aims to assess published literature describing disparities in craniosynostosis care and to summarize the findings surrounding patient proximity to care centers and familial socioeconomic status as predictors of surgical management and outcomes. The data sources used include PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist was used for appraisal of the quality of the studies included. Generally, the literature reviewed suggested that socioeconomic variables including race, insurance payor, and median zip code income quartile are predictors of suboptimal craniosynostosis surgical management outcomes including older age at time of surgery and more invasive surgical approach performed. The only geospatial data element assessed was the general region of the hospital where the patient was treated. The review highlighted various knowledge gaps within published literature describing health-related disparities in patients with craniosynostosis. There is a paucity of research assessing geospatial access to craniosynostosis care centers, suggesting that further research should be performed to evaluate this potential disparity. In addition, previous studies lack granularity when assessing socioeconomic factors and only one study accounted for suture fused, which is a potential confounding variable across the other published work. These considerations should be addressed in future studies addressing this topic. The limitations of this review include potential publication bias given that unpublished work was not included. An element of reviewer bias also exists considering only one reviewer screened the articles and extracted the data."}

{"id": "PUB_80", "text": "Evaluation of Eligibility Criteria Relevance for the Purpose of IT-Supported BACKGROUND: Clinical trials (CTs) are crucial for medical research; however, they frequently fall short of the requisite number of participants who meet all eligibility criteria (EC). A clinical trial recruitment support system (CTRSS) is developed to help identify potential participants by performing a search on a specific data pool. The accuracy of the search results is directly related to the quality of the data used for comparison. Data accessibility can present challenges, making it crucial to identify the necessary data for a CTRSS to query. Prior research has examined the data elements frequently used in CT EC but has not evaluated which criteria are actually used to search for participants. Although all EC must be met to enroll a person in a CT, not all criteria have the same importance when searching for potential participants in an existing data pool, such as an electronic health record, because some of the criteria are only relevant at the time of enrollment. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated which groups of data elements are relevant in practice for finding suitable participants and whether there are typical elements that are not relevant and can therefore be omitted. METHODS: We asked trial experts and CTRSS developers to first categorize the EC of their CTs according to data element groups and then to classify them into 1 of 3 categories: necessary, complementary, and irrelevant. In addition, the experts assessed whether a criterion was documented (on paper or digitally) or whether it was information known only to the treating physicians or patients. RESULTS: We reviewed 82 CTs with 1132 unique EC. Of these 1132 EC, 350 (30.9%) were considered necessary, 224 (19.8%) complementary, and 341 (30.1%) total irrelevant. To identify the most relevant data elements, we introduced the data element relevance index (DERI). This describes the percentage of studies in which the corresponding data element occurs and is also classified as necessary or supplementary. We found that the query of \"diagnosis\" was relevant for finding participants in 79 (96.3%) of the CTs. This group was followed by \"date of birth/age\" with a DERI of 85.4% (n=70) and \"procedure\" with a DERI of 35.4% (n=29). CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of data element groups in CTs has been heterogeneously described in previous works. Therefore, we recommend identifying the percentage of CTs in which data element groups can be found as a more reliable way to determine the relevance of EC. Only necessary and complementary criteria should be included in this DERI."}

However, it is still underutilized in surgical specialties. Postsurgical patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation have increased mortality and costs of care; outcomes from adding palliative care services to this population have been poorly investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of palliative medicine consultation on readmission rates and hospitalization costs in postsurgical patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. METHODS: The Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried for adults (> 18 years) between the years 2010 and 2014 who underwent a major operation (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project [HCUP] data element ORPROC = 1), required mechanical ventilation for ≥ 96 consecutive hours (ICD-9-CM V46.1), and survived until discharge. Among these, patients who received a palliative medicine consultation during hospitalization were identified using the ICD-9-CM diagnosis code V66.7. RESULTS: Of 53,450 included patients, 3.4% received a palliative care consultation. Compared to patients who did not receive a palliative care consultation, patients who did receive a consultation had a lower readmission rate (14.8% vs. 24.8%, p < 0.001) and lower average cost of hospitalization during the initial admission ($109,007 vs. $124,218, p < 0.001), findings that persisted after multivariable logistic regression. CONCLUSION: Utilization of palliative care in surgical patients remains low. Palliative care consultation in postsurgical patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation was associated with lower cost and rate of readmission.

The impetus for the current update stemmed from significant advances in the field and insights from registry development and regional comparisons. This 2024 update involved representatives of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and used a modified Delphi process. Every 2015 Utstein data element was reviewed for relevance, priority (core or supplemental), and improvement. New variables were proposed and refined. All changes were voted on for inclusion. The 2015 domains-system, dispatch, patient, process, and outcomes-were retained. Further clarity is provided for the definitions of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest attended resuscitation and attempted resuscitation. Changes reflect advancements in dispatch, early response systems, and resuscitation care, as well as the importance of prehospital outcomes. Time intervals such as emergency medical service response time now emphasize precise reporting of the times used.

As radiation oncology is a rather technical, data-driven discipline, standardization, and data exchange are in principle possible. We examined electronic healthcare documents to extract structured information. Planning CT order entry documents were chosen for the analysis, as this covers a common and structured step in radiation oncology, for which standardized documentation may be achieved. The aim was to examine the extent to which relevant information may be exchanged among different institutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We contacted representatives of nine radiation oncology departments. Departments using standardized electronic documentation for planning CT were asked to provide templates of their records, which were analyzed in terms of form and content. Structured information was extracted by identifying definite common data elements, containing explicit information. Relevant common data elements were identified and classified. A quantitative analysis was performed to evaluate the possibility of data exchange. RESULTS: We received data of seven documents that were heterogeneous regarding form and content. 181 definite common data elements considered relevant for the planning CT were identified and assorted into five semantic groups. 139 data elements (76.8%) were present in only one document. The other 42 data elements were present in two to six documents, while none was shared among all seven documents. CONCLUSION: Structured and interoperable documentation of medical information can be achieved using common data elements. Our analysis showed that a lot of information recorded with healthcare documents can be presented with this approach. Yet, in the analyzed cohort of planning CT order entries, only a few common data elements were shared among the majority of documents.

EudraVigilance (EV) serves as the primary system for managing and analysing information concerning suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) within the European Economic Area. Despite its various functionalities, the current format for electronic submissions of safety reports lacks a specific data element indicating medicine exposure during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to address the limitations of existing approaches by developing a rule-based algorithm in EV that more reliably identifies cases that are truly representative of an ADR during pregnancy. METHODS: The study utilised the standardised MedDRA query (SMQ) 'Pregnancy and neonatal topics' (PNT) as a benchmark for comparison. Recognising that the SMQ PNT also retrieves healthy pregnancy outcomes, contraceptive failure, failed abortifacients as well as ADRs not associated with pregnancy, a novel algorithm was tailored to improve the accuracy of identifying suspected ADRs occurring during pregnancy. RESULTS: Upon testing, the algorithm demonstrated superior performance, correctly predicting 90% of cases reporting an ADR during pregnancy, compared to 54% achieved by the SMQ PNT. The implementation of the algorithm in EV led to the retrieval of 202,426 cases. CONCLUSION: The development and successful testing of the novel algorithm represents a step forward in pregnancy-specific signal detection in EV. Because signals associated with pregnancy may be diluted in a large database such as EV, this study lays the groundwork for future research to evaluate the effectiveness of disproportionality methods on a more refined subset of pregnancy-related ADR reports."}

Improvements in lung cancer treatment can be obtained through clinical trials, yet there are disparities in clinical trial enrollment of other cancer types. This study aims to evaluate disparities in lung cancer clinical trial enrollment to inform future enrollment initiatives. METHODS: We analyzed patients with non-small cell lung cancer from the National Cancer Database (2004-2018), categorizing them as enrolled or not enrolled in clinical trials based on \"rx_summ_other\" data element. Clinical, demographic, and institutional factors associated with trial enrollment were assessed using bivariate and multivariate analysis, adjusting for institutional-level clustering. RESULTS: A total of 1924 (0.12%) patients with lung cancer were enrolled in clinical trials. Enrolled patients were predominantly non-Hispanic White (82%), with greater socioeconomic status, treated at academic programs (67%), and had private insurance (42%) or Medicare (44%). They also traveled further for treatment compared with unenrolled patients (56 vs 27 miles, P < .001). After adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, lung cancer trial enrollment was significantly less likely among Black (odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.7, P < .001) and Hispanic (0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.9, P = .01) patients. Patients with Medicaid or uninsured, in the lowest socioeconomic status group, and those treated at community-based cancer programs were the least likely to enroll. CONCLUSIONS: Enrollment in lung cancer trials disproportionally excludes minority patients, those in the lowest socioeconomic status, community cancer programs, and the underinsured. These disparities in demographic and access for trial participation show a need for improved enrollment strategies."}
{"id": "PUB_93", "text": "Creation of Standardized Common Data Elements for Diagnostic Tests in Infectious BACKGROUND: It is necessary to harmonize and standardize data variables used in case report forms (CRFs) of clinical studies to facilitate the merging and sharing of the collected patient data across several clinical studies. This is particularly true for clinical studies that focus on infectious diseases. Public health may be highly dependent on the findings of such studies. Hence, there is an elevated urgency to generate meaningful, reliable insights, ideally based on a high sample number and quality data. The implementation of core data elements and the incorporation of interoperability standards can facilitate the creation of harmonized clinical data sets. OBJECTIVE: This study's objective was to compare, harmonize, and standardize variables focused on diagnostic tests used as part of CRFs in 6 international clinical studies of infectious diseases in order to, ultimately, then make available the panstudy common data elements (CDEs) for ongoing and future studies to foster interoperability and comparability of collected data across trials. METHODS: We reviewed and compared the metadata that comprised the CRFs used for data collection in and across all 6 infectious disease studies under consideration in order to identify CDEs. We examined the availability of international semantic standard codes within the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms, the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus, and the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes system for the unambiguous representation of diagnostic testing information that makes up the CDEs. We then proposed 2 data models that incorporate semantic and syntactic standards for the identified CDEs. RESULTS: Of 216 variables that were considered in the scope of the analysis, we identified 11 CDEs to describe diagnostic tests (in particular, serology and sequencing) for infectious diseases: viral lineage/clade; test date, type, performer, and manufacturer; target gene; quantitative and qualitative results; and specimen identifier, type, and collection date. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of CDEs for infectious diseases is the first step in facilitating the exchange and possible merging of a subset of data across clinical studies (and with that, large research projects) for possible shared analysis to increase the power of findings. The path to harmonization and standardization of clinical study data in the interest of interoperability can be paved in 2 ways. First, a map to standard terminologies ensures that each data element's (variable's) definition is unambiguous and that it has a single, unique interpretation across studies. Second, the exchange of these data is assisted by \"wrapping\" them in a standard exchange format, such as Fast Health care Interoperability Resources or the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium's Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization Model."}

Because existing processes for new data collections through the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System were not well suited for implementation during emergency responses at the time of the mpox outbreak, several interim notification approaches were established to capture case data. These interim approaches were successful in generating daily case counts, monitoring disease transmission, and identifying high-risk populations. However, the approaches also required several data collection approvals by the federal government and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, the use of four different case report forms, and the establishment of complex data management and validation processes involving data element mapping and record-level de-duplication steps.

Identification of the various barriers to entry into care that patients experience may inform and improve health care provision and, in turn, improve the patient's ability to receive necessary care. AIM: This study implements a mixed-methods approach to establish methods and procedures for identifying barriers to early entry to prenatal care in a medically-vulnerable patient population and areas for future quality improvement initiatives. METHODS: An initial chart review was conducted on obstetrics patients that initiated prenatal care after their first trimester at a large federally qualified health center in Brooklyn, NY, to determine patient-specified reasons for delay. A thematic analysis of these data was implemented in combination with both parametric and non-parametric analyses to characterize the population of interest, and to identify the primary determinants of delayed entry. RESULTS: The age of patients in the population of interest (n = 169) was bimodal, with a range of 15 - 43 years and a mean of 28 years. The mean gestational age of entry into prenatal care was 19 weeks. The chart review revealed that 8% recently moved to Brooklyn from outside of NYC or the USA. Nine percent had difficulty scheduling an initial prenatal visit within their first trimester. Teenage pregnancy accounted for 7%. Provider challenges with documentation (21%) were noted. The most common themes identified (n = 155) were the patient being in transition (21%), the pregnancy being unplanned (17%), and issues with linkage to care (15%), including no shows or patient cancellations. Patients who were late to prenatal care also differed from their peers dramatically, as they were more likely to be Spanish-speaking, to be young, and to experience a relatively long delay between pregnancy confirmation and entry into care. Moreover, the greatest determinant of delayed entry into care was patient age. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a process for other like clinics to identify patients who are at risk for delayed entry to prenatal care and highlight common barriers to entry. Future initiatives include the introduction of a smart data element to document reasons for delay and use of community health workers for dedicated outreach after no show appointments or patient cancellations."}
